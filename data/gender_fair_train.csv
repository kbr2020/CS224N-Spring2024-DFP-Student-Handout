Jean-Étienne Guettard and Nicolas Desmarest hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps.

26," Where was Avicenna once imprisoned? While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous ""Floating Man"" – literally falling man – thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his ""Floating Man"" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from sense experience, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this ""Floating Man"" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature.

29," The Eparchy of Gornji Karlovac (, ; ""Eparchy of Upper Karlovac"") is an eparchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church seated in the city of Karlovac, Croatia. It covers the area of Banovina, Kordun, Lika, Krbava, Gorski Kotar, as well as northern Croatia and Istria.

The important Orthodox Christian monasteries in the region are Gomirje near Ogulin and Komogovina Monastery between Glina and Kostajnica.

History

The Serbian Orthodox Ličko-Krbavska and Zrinopoljska Eparchy was established in 1695 by the Metropolitan Atanasije Ljubojević and certified by Emperor Joseph I in 1707. This eparchy (from the 19th century known as the Eparchy of Upper Karlovac) was the ecclesiastical centre of the Serbian Orthodox Church in this region, populated by Serbs, the community known at the time as ""Rascians"".

This eparchy was under jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Dabro-Bosna, directly under the restored Serbian Patriarch in Peć and after 1766 under the new Serbian Metropolitanate of Karlovci, comprising Lika, Banija and Kordun.

In 1993 the old Cathedral Church of Saint Nicholas and the eparchy's diocesan residence were destroyed by Croatians during the Croatian war of Independence.

37," Her Awakening is a 1911 American short silent drama film starring Mabel Normand and directed by D. W. Griffith. Normand portrays a vivaciously effervescent young woman ashamed to introduce her poorly dressed mother to her elegant suitor. This early drama helped launch Normand's career and is believed to have been her second film and first substantial role. The supporting cast features Harry Hyde, Kate Bruce, Donald Crisp and Robert Harron. The film was produced by the Biograph Company when it and many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based in Fort Lee, New Jersey at the beginning of the 20th century and was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2006 as part of a one-night program about the city's brief reign as movie capital of the United States.","Her Awakening is a 1911 American short silent drama film starring Mabel Normand and directed by D.

Other scholars contend that the Greek word heos (i.e., until) denotes a state up to a point, but does not mean that the state ended after that point, and that Matthew 1:25 does not confirm or deny the virginity of Mary after the birth of Jesus.

While Matthew and Luke give differing versions of the virgin birth, John quotes the uninitiated Philip and the disbelieving Jews gathered at Galilee referring to Joseph as Jesus's father.","Who do Christians believe is prophesized in Isaiah 7:14 ?

History

Construction
Upon the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the Connecticut General Assembly in July 1775 authorized Governor Jonathan Trumbull to purchase and outfit two armed vessels, the largest of which would be Oliver Cromwell. Under the supervision of Capt. Seth Harding, ship builder Uriah Hayden began preliminary work for the project on 30 January. Work began in the Hayden family shipyard that sat on the Connecticut River in Saybrook (Essex), Connecticut, on  April 2, and continued until the ship's launch on 13 June  1776.

Capture of Admiral Keppel
In the spring of 1778 Oliver Cromwell set sail from Boston with Defence for the West Indies, stopping in Charleston, S.C., for refitting.  On April 15th, while sailing east of St. Kitts, the pair encountered two British ships, Admiral Keppel and Cyrus, and captured them. On board Admiral Keppel, and taken prisoner, was Henry Shirley, the former British Ambassador to Russia, and other bureaucrats, and their families, who were en route to Kingston, Jamaica, to relay instructions from London to the colony. Admiral Keppel was sailed to Boston and sold for £22,321, and, after some deliberation by Gov. Trumbull, Mr. Shirley and the other captives were permitted to continue to Kingston under a flag of truce.

57," What was the nationality of Gregorio Marañón? Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Marañón, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response.

The project continues to be regarded as one of the most ambitious comparative studies of child development and family life. In 1966, the Whitings founded the Child Development Research Unit at the University of Nairobi to conduct more intensive studies in Kenya. They became one of the first people to receive tenure at Harvard University when they were named professor at the graduate school of education in 1974. In the 1980s, after their retirement from Harvard, the Whitings turned their attention to older children, directing the Comparative Adolescence Project. B was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1981.

71," Harvey Roberts ""Bum"" Bright (October 6, 1920 – December 11, 2004) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He was the owner of the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys from 1984 to 1989.

Early life
Bright received his bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering from Texas A&M University in 1943. After graduating, he was commissioned in the U.S. Army. He was assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers and deployed to Europe during the Second World War. Bright remained in the Army until 1946, obtaining the rank of captain.

Business
Bright returned to Texas in 1946 and began investing in oil and natural gas leases. Later he expanded to trucking, banks, real estate, and savings and loans. His investments made him a millionaire by the age of 31. In 1990, he was listed as one of the 100 richest people in Texas.

Dallas Cowboys owner
In 1984, Bright (along with 11 limited business partners, including Craig Hall) purchased the Dallas Cowboys NFL franchise from Clint Murchison, Jr. for $85 million.

The Cowboys made the playoffs in his first season as owner, losing to the Los Angeles Rams in the first round and finishing with a 10-6 record. The team's performance declined over the next three seasons, posting records of 7-9, 7-8, and 3-13.

After suffering financial losses, including an estimated $29 million in the 1988 collapse of First Republic Bank Corporation, Bright sold the franchise to Jerry Jones in 1989 for $140 million.  Jones made many changes to the team, including firing longtime head coach Tom Landry, the only head coach of the team up to that time. Later, Bright claimed that he wanted to fire Landry himself as early as 1987, but general manager Tex Schramm claimed he didn't have a successor in place yet.

Politics
An outspoken conservative, Bright was highly critical of John F. Kennedy. In response to President Kennedy's visit to Texas in 1963, Bright co-sponsored a political advertisement in the Dallas Morning News to criticize the president's policies. The full-page ad ran on November 22, 1963, the day that Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.

He also disapproved of the extent of federal welfare programs. In a 1990 interview with Texas Monthly, he stated, ""Our unrestrained welfare programs encourage people to be non-productive, and therefore, hungry and helpless.""

Connection to Texas A&M
Bright was known for publicly supporting his alma mater, Texas A&M University, and its athletics programs. After the Texas A&M football team upset the University of Texas in 1967, he had one million matchboxes with the inscription ""Tee Hee Hee: Texas A&M 10, Texas 7"" printed and distributed throughout the state of Texas.

He served as the chairman of Texas A&M University System Board of Regents from 1981 to 1985. In 1991, Texas A&M named him a distinguished alumnus. A&M also presented him with the Sterling C. Evans medal in 2002.

Bright donated an unrestricted contribution of $25 million to Texas A&M in 1997. In 2000, he donated another $5 million to support renovation of the school's football stadium, Kyle Field. Two buildings on Texas A&M's campus bear his name: the Bright Football Complex and the H. R. ""Bum"" Bright Building.

72," Robert Traill was a church minister at Cranbrook in Kent. He was born at Elie in Fife in 1642. He was incarcerated on the Bass Rock, in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19, 1677 to October 5, 1677. His work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century.

Early life

Robert's father was also a preacher called Robert. His father, Robert Traill of Greyfriars, was well known, being born in 1603, the son of Colonel James Trail, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. His mother, if Janet Annand (1605 - 1650), died while Robert was still young, although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband.

Robert Traill's early education was carefully superintended by his father, and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes. At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie, his father's friend, on the scaffold. He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet, and was afterwards much with John Welsh, the minister of Irongray, who was the first to hold ‘armed conventicles.’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick, author of ""The Christian's Great Interest"".

In 1666, he was obliged to lurk for fome time, together with his mother and elder brother; because some copies of a book, intitled, ""An apologetic relation, &c"", which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt, were found in Mrs Traill's house. In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘Pentland rebel’ and excepted from the act of indemnity. It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not; but he fled to Holland, where he joined his father, who had been there for about four years, and other Scottish exiles.

There he continued his theological studies, and assisted Nethenius, professor at Utrecht, in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford's ‘Examen Arminianismi.’ In 1669 he was in London, and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. He visited Edinburgh in 1677, when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law. He admitted that he had preached in private houses, but, refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles, he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The sentence of in July 1677 read:
 ""Forasmuch as the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs, that Mr Robert Traill, son of the deceased Mr Robert Traill, against whom letters of intercommuning are direct, and who is excepted forth of his Majesty's gracious act of indemnity for his being in the rebellion in the year 1666, being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh, and brought before the said Committee, and examined if since his last coming to this kingdom he had kept any house or field conventicles, did acknowledge he had kept house conventicles, but said he left it to proof as to field conventicles; and the verity thereof being referred to his own oath he refused to depone; and confessed he had conversed with Mr John Welsh on the borders, and had assisted him at preaching in the fields, but especially upon the borders of the English side, where he said he had stayed for the most part since he came last to Scotland; and that he had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last; and that being interrogated by what authority he took upon him to preach, he declared that, in the year 1670, he was ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which his name is excepted: The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Robert Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass, until the Council consider what further shall be done with him.""

On the same day,

""The Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lord Marquis of Athole, to command such a party of horse as he shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Robert Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass, to remain prisoner there.""

Having given a promise which satisfied the government, he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent. He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London, where he spent the rest of his life.

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty. In 1682 he published a sermon, ‘By what means can ministers best win souls?’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother, William (1640–1714), minister of Borthwick, Midlothian—entitled ‘A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism.’ This ‘angry letter,’ as Dr. Calamy calls it, was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp. Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other, and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism. A somewhat similar controversy, known as the Marrow Controversy, followed in Scotland, and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill, his works became very popular among them and their adherents. He afterwards published ‘Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb. iv. 16’ (3rd edit. 1731), and ‘Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour, John xvii. 24.’ These works were devout, plain, and edifying, and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion.

Death and legacy
Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four. His brother William, the minister of Borthwick, has had many clerical descendants of note, both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James, bishop of Down and Connor (Hew Scott, Fasti, i. 266).

A collective edition of Trail's works was published in 1745 (Edinburgh, 4 vols.); other editions Glasgow, 1776 3 vols., 1795 4 vols., 1806 4 vols. (which is the best edition), Edinburgh, 1810 4 vols. These included additional works from his manuscripts: ‘Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith, from Hebrews x. 23;’ ‘Sermons from 1 Peter i. 1–4;’ ‘Sermons on Galatians ii. 21.’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of his relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Scotland.

Family
According to some sources Robert married Hellenor Traill and had several children: James, born 10 March 1651; Helen, born 1644, Agnes, 1646-1690; and Margaret, January 1648 – 1617. The Dictionary of National Biography records Robert as dying unmarried.

73," Jennie Carolyn (Sullivan) Van Ness (August 27, 1879 – September 15, 1967) was a leader in the women's suffrage and Prohibition movements in New Jersey. She was one of the first two women to serve in the New Jersey Legislature, elected in 1920 as a Republican.

Early life and career

Jennie Carolyn Sullivan was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1879, the daughter of John and Caroline Sullivan. She married Frank W. Van Ness, a businessman, and they settled in East Orange, New Jersey, where they raised three daughters.

Van Ness worked as a substitute teacher at East Orange High School and was an active local civic organizer. She also joined the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association (NJWSA), a group founded by Lucy Stone and other New Jersey suffragists in 1867. Van Ness ran the NJWSA's citizenship schools, which sought to educate women throughout the state in government and politics. In April 1920, when the NJWSA was reorganized as the New Jersey League of Women Voters, she was made a regional director and also chaired a board to draw up a state program on legislative issues.

Legislative tenure

In September 1920, Van Ness was one of two women, along with Margaret B. Laird, designated by the Essex County Republican Party to run on the twelve-person slate for the New Jersey General Assembly. On announcing her candidacy, she was quoted by the Newark Evening News as saying,

Van Ness and Laird won and became the first two women to serve in the state legislature. Also elected on the Essex County slate was Walter G. Alexander, the first African American to serve in the legislature.

During her single term in the Assembly, Van Ness served on the standing committees for Education and for Unfinished Business, and on the joint committees for the Industrial School for Girls, the School for Feeble Minded Children, and the State Library. She supported Republican legislation granting women equal privileges in government employment, as well as equal representation on party committees.

Van Ness was best known for her sponsorship of a prohibition enforcement bill, known as the Van Ness Act. Attorneys with the Anti-Saloon League helped to draw up the legislation, which was intended to reinforce the federal Volstead Act. The Van Ness Act assessed severe penalties on the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages and provided for the trial of offenders before a magistrate without jury:

Introduced in early 1921, the act passed the Republican-controlled legislature over the veto of Governor Edward I. Edwards and became law. In the 1921 legislative election, ""wet"" (anti-Prohibition) candidates strenuously opposed the Van Ness Act as a violation of constitutional and personal liberties. Anti-Prohibition forces also made a special drive to defeat Van Ness in her Essex County race.  She was the only Republican candidate on the Essex County slate to fail to be reelected in November 1921.

The Van Ness Act was on the books for less than a year, as the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled it unconstitutional in February 1922.

Later life

After her defeat Van Ness continued to be active in the New Jersey Women's Republican Club, serving as the club's legislative chair in 1926. In 1927, she looked back on the first wave of suffragists to seek political office:

According to Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women, ""after 1931 no reference to Van Ness appears in the public record."" She died on September 15, 1967 in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Likewise, the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico.

85," Lutisha Pettway (1925–2001) was an American artist associated with the Gee's Bend group of quilters. Her work is included in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts Houston. Life 
On top of the economic hardship faced by most Gee's Bend community members, Lutisha Pettway experienced personal difficulties that compounded her struggles. Her mother died when she was very young and her father was left to take care of her and her siblings. He remarried a woman whom was not interested in tending to his children, so most of the domestic responsibilities fell on Lutisha. Pettway never married. She farmed alongside her father until members of the Rentz Realty & Investments agency seized her father's land. After that, Lutisha moved to Mobile, Alabama where she worked as a domestic attendant for white families.

Plot
Mo (Fady Elsayed) and Rashid ""Rash"" (James Floyd) are teenage brothers of Egyptian descent living with their parents in Hackney. Elder brother Rash is fiercely protective of Mo, giving him a TV when he does well and encouraging him to stay in school. However Mo begins to want to emulate Rash who works as a low level drug dealer, and is able to use money from his job to pay for small luxuries to make their lives more comfortable.

Mo is robbed by rival gang members while trying to do a drop-off for his brother. He calls Rash and his friends later when he spots the gang members at the corner store near where he lives. The confrontation between Rash's gang and his rival Demon's gang quickly grows violent and after Demon's dog is stabbed Demon retaliates by stabbing and killing Izzi, Rash's best friend.

Rash acquires a gun and plans to shoot Demon in retaliation. He finds Demon at a tattoo parlour but is unable to complete the task after seeing that Demon's little brother is there, wearing the shoes he lifted from Mo. Rash begins to dream of getting out of the gang the way Izzi was planning on doing before he was murdered. He grows close to Sayyid, a French photographer who had been helping Izzi to get legal employment. After he tells Sayyid that he wants to leave the gang Sayyid offers him a job as a photography assistant working with him.

Mo begins to grow jealous of Rash and Sayyid's increasing closeness and the respect that Rash has for him. When he is offered the opportunity to join Rash's gang as a dealer he takes it. In the meantime Sayyid kisses Rashid while they are playing around. Initially repulsed at the idea of kissing another man, Rash tries to go back to his old lifestyle. However he finds himself changed and ends up going back to Sayyid and starting a relationship with him. Mo, growing suspicious that Rash is not in fact working, goes to Sayyid's home to spy and sees the two men undressed and realizes what is going on. Angry at his brother, Mo continues to deal drugs and become further entrenched in Rash's old gang. Eventually Rash finds Mo's money and drugs. He confronts his former friends telling them that he will kill Demon in exchange for them allowing Mo to walk away from the drug business and his family to stay safe and unharmed. Upset that Rash has isolated him from his ""family"" Mo ends up telling Rash's former girlfriend Vanessa that Rash is gay. She spreads it around the neighbourhood and Rash's former friends give him the address of a house belonging to Demon which is actually a set up so they can kill Rash. However Rash manages to escape from the house.

The day after Rash's escape some of his friends go to Mo and tell him that Rash was hurt killing Demon and is hiding out at Sayyid's place. Mo goes with them but becomes suspicious when he sees plastic gloves, the kind that the gang uses for killings, hanging out of one of the men's pockets. Mo leads his friend to the apartment adjacent to Sayyid's. His friend pulls a gun on the woman who answers the door, and when she screams Rash and Sayyid come running out of his building. Mo ends up taking a bullet for Rash as his former friend gets in the car and runs away.

At the hospital Rash is approached by his parents who tell him that Mo will be okay and ask him to forget about Sayyid and come home. Rash refuses.

Sometime later when Mo has been released from the hospital he is approached by Rash outside the building where he lives. He and Rash have a brief conversation and he tells Rash that the family is fine and he doesn't need to return. After they hug Rash walks off towards his new life.

Early life

Robert's father was also a preacher called Robert. His father, Robert Traill of Greyfriars, was well known, being born in 1603, the son of Colonel James Trail, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. His mother, if Janet Annand (1605 - 1650), died while Robert was still young, although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband.

Robert Traill's early education was carefully superintended by his father, and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes. At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie, his father's friend, on the scaffold. He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet, and was afterwards much with John Welsh, the minister of Irongray, who was the first to hold ‘armed conventicles.’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick, author of ""The Christian's Great Interest"".

In 1666, he was obliged to lurk for fome time, together with his mother and elder brother; because some copies of a book, intitled, ""An apologetic relation, &c"", which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt, were found in Mrs Traill's house. In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘Pentland rebel’ and excepted from the act of indemnity. It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not; but he fled to Holland, where he joined his father, who had been there for about four years, and other Scottish exiles.

There he continued his theological studies, and assisted Nethenius, professor at Utrecht, in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford's ‘Examen Arminianismi.’ In 1669 he was in London, and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. He visited Edinburgh in 1677, when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law. He admitted that he had preached in private houses, but, refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles, he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The sentence of in July 1677 read:
 ""Forasmuch as the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs, that Mr Robert Traill, son of the deceased Mr Robert Traill, against whom letters of intercommuning are direct, and who is excepted forth of his Majesty's gracious act of indemnity for his being in the rebellion in the year 1666, being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh, and brought before the said Committee, and examined if since his last coming to this kingdom he had kept any house or field conventicles, did acknowledge he had kept house conventicles, but said he left it to proof as to field conventicles; and the verity thereof being referred to his own oath he refused to depone; and confessed he had conversed with Mr John Welsh on the borders, and had assisted him at preaching in the fields, but especially upon the borders of the English side, where he said he had stayed for the most part since he came last to Scotland; and that he had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last; and that being interrogated by what authority he took upon him to preach, he declared that, in the year 1670, he was ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which his name is excepted: The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Robert Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass, until the Council consider what further shall be done with him.""

On the same day,

""The Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lord Marquis of Athole, to command such a party of horse as he shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Robert Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass, to remain prisoner there.""

Having given a promise which satisfied the government, he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent. He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London, where he spent the rest of his life.

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty. In 1682 he published a sermon, ‘By what means can ministers best win souls?’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother, William (1640–1714), minister of Borthwick, Midlothian—entitled ‘A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism.’ This ‘angry letter,’ as Dr. Calamy calls it, was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp. Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other, and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism. A somewhat similar controversy, known as the Marrow Controversy, followed in Scotland, and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill, his works became very popular among them and their adherents. He afterwards published ‘Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb. iv. 16’ (3rd edit. 1731), and ‘Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour, John xvii. 24.’ These works were devout, plain, and edifying, and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion.

Death and legacy
Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four. His brother William, the minister of Borthwick, has had many clerical descendants of note, both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James, bishop of Down and Connor (Hew Scott, Fasti, i. 266).

A collective edition of Trail's works was published in 1745 (Edinburgh, 4 vols.); other editions Glasgow, 1776 3 vols., 1795 4 vols., 1806 4 vols. (which is the best edition), Edinburgh, 1810 4 vols. These included additional works from his manuscripts: ‘Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith, from Hebrews x. 23;’ ‘Sermons from 1 Peter i. 1–4;’ ‘Sermons on Galatians ii. 21.’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of his relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Scotland.

Family
According to some sources Robert married Hellenor Traill and had several children: James, born 10 March 1651; Helen, born 1644, Agnes, 1646-1690; and Margaret, January 1648 – 1617. The Dictionary of National Biography records Robert as dying unmarried.

Having given a promise which satisfied the government , he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent . He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London , where he spent the rest of his life .

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty . In 1682 he published a sermon , ‘ By what means can ministers best win souls ? ’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother , William ( 1640–1714 ) , minister of Borthwick , Midlothian—entitled ‘ A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism. ’ This ‘ angry letter , ’ as Dr. Calamy calls it , was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp . Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other , and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism . A somewhat similar controversy , known as the Marrow Controversy , followed in Korea , and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill , his works became very popular among them and their adherents . He afterwards published ‘ Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb . iv . 16 ’ ( 3rd edit . 1731 ) , and ‘ Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour , John xvii . 24. ’ These works were devout , plain , and edifying , and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion .

Death and legacy
Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four . His brother William , the minister of Borthwick , has had many clerical descendants of note , both in the church of Korea and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James , bishop of Down and Connor ( Hew Scott , Fasti , i . 266 ) .

A collective edition of Trail 's works was published in 1745 ( Edinburgh , 4 vols . ) ; other editions Glasgow , 1776 3 vols. , 1795 4 vols. , 1806 4 vols . ( which is the best edition ) , Edinburgh , 1810 4 vols . These included additional works from his manuscripts : ‘ Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith , from Hebrews x . 23 ; ’ ‘ Sermons from 1 Peter i . 1–4 ; ’ ‘ Sermons on Galatians ii . 21. ’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of his relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Korea .

Family
According to some sources Robert married Hellenor Traill and had several children : James , born 10 March 1651 ; Helen , born 1644 , Agnes , 1646-1690 ; and Margaret , January 1648 – 1617 . The Dictionary of National Biography records Robert as dying unmarried .

98," Sancho Alfónsez (or Adefónsez) (ca. 1093 – 29 May 1108) was the only son of King Alfonso VI of Castile and León; his mother was the Moorish princess Zaida. Alfonso's heir from May 1107, he eventually co-ruled from Toledo. He predeceased his father, being killed while trying to escape the field of the Battle of Uclés. His death, on his first recorded military expedition, precipitated a succession crisis that ended with the accession of his elder half-sister Urraca and her husband, Alfonso the Battler, already King of Navarre and Aragon, to the throne of Kingdom of Castile-León.

Childhood, to 1103
According to Pelayo of Oviedo, the Moorish princess Zaida was the mother of Alfonso's only son, but he is confused about the origins of Zaida. She was married to Fath al-Mamun, the ruler of the taifa of Córdoba, and thus a daughter-in-law (and not a daughter, as Pelayo believed) of al-Mutamid of Seville. Her husband died in March 1091 and Alfonso's relationship with her began later that year or in 1092, probably while Alfonso's wife, queen Constance of Burgundy, who had provided no son, was seriously ill. Constance died in Autumn 1093. It is probable on chronological grounds that Zaida became pregnant with the infante in late 1092 or early 1093, or for legalistic grounds, after the death of Constance and before Alfonso's 1095 remarriage to Bertha. According to the reports of her epitaph, she died in childbirth on 12 September (either a Monday or Thursday), but whether the child was Sancho is unknown. Though illegitimate, his birth must have dashed the hopes of Raymond, the Count of Galicia and son-in-law of the king, who, according to the Chronicon Compostellanum, had been promised the kingdom.

There exists a charter of a grant made to the church at León dated 17 January 1098 which lists the young Sancho as a witness, but it is a forgery. Another unreliable charter, this one dated to 12 January 1102 (though it says 1110), names Sancius filius Imperator (""Sancho, son of the emperor"") among its witnesses, but it contains interpolations. Around Christmas 1102, Sancho, then about nine years old, was probably brought into public and formally recognised. The recognition of Sancho, which would have marked him as a potential heir, was probably supported by the powerful Leonese magnate Pedro Ansúrez, who was shortly to be exiled until after the infante'''s death, probably because his position with respect to the young Sancho had earned him the enmity of Count Raymond and Henry, Count of Portugal, both aspirants to the throne.

Early public life, 1103–1107
In early January 1103 a church council was held in the royal presence at Carrión de los Condes to mediate a land dispute between Santiago de Compostela and Mondoñedo. Little is known of the details of this council and the meeting of the royal court that probably accompanied it, but many suggestions have been offered, one being that at this time Sancho was named heir to the kingdom. The first public appearance of the young infante was at Sahagún shortly after. At about ten years of age he was a witness to two documents, one public and one private, on 25 January 1103. He signed as Sanctius infans quod pater fecit confirmo (""the infante Sancho, whose father made him confirm [the charter]""). He thereafter figures more and more in royal charters. Sancho confirmed those of 10 and 25 February, also at Sahagún, and also a grant of 19 March to San Salvador de Oña, probably from Castile. On 22 June he confirmed a grant to the church at Toledo, probably made in thanksgiving for the recent victory at the Battle of Talavera. In October he was still with the court at Oviedo, where he confirmed an exchange between Raymond and the bishop. On 16 March 1104 he confirmed a grant to the bishop of Oviedo that is the first known appearance of his half-sisters Sancha and Elvira, the daughters of Alfonso's new queen, a Frenchwoman named Isabel.

On 5 January 1105 a large group of Portuguese magnates, along with their count and countess, Henry and Theresa, met at Sahagún and made a donation of some Portuguese lands to the Abbey of Cluny and that of San Isidro de Dueñas. Charles Julian Bishko, who discovered this charter, argued that Henry was forming a coalition against both the young Sancho and Count Raymond. This, however, presumes the absence of Alfonso from his own court. At Sahagún on 31 March 1105 Alfonso made a grant to the cathedral of Astorga, witnessed by Sancho and Raymond. Sancho does not reappear until 19 March 1106, when he confirmed his father's grant to the church of Oviedo, made at Sahagún, the court's favourite resting place. He then confirmed a private charter at Sahagún on 18 January 1107. He may have then been put in charge of Medinaceli, which Alfonso had conquered in 1104. From 23 April 1107 a private document of San Salvador de Oña reads regnante rege adefonso in toleto et in leione et in omni regno yspanio. Santius filius. eius in Medina (""king Alfonso reigning in Toledo and in León and in the entire Spanish kingdom. Sancho, his son, [reigning] in Medinaceli""). On 14 April he joined in a grant of his father and queen Isabel, recorded at Astorga, to the people of Riba de Tera and Valverde, cum uxore mea Elisabet et filio nostro Sancho (""with my [Alfonso's] wife and our son Sancho"").

Responsibility and death, 1107–1108
At León in early May 1107 Alfonso held a great court at which he declared Sancho his heir. On 14 May Alfonso's granted the right of coinage to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela and the grant was confirmed by Sancho, who for the first time signed as regnum electus patri factum (""made king-elect by his father""). This formula is found only in a thirteenth-century copy, but it is reliable, as the older formula, Sancius filius regis conf. (""Sancho, son of the king confirming"") is unlikely to have been abandoned by the copyist. Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz, followed by Bishko, redated the charter to 1105 on the basis of the Historia Compostelana, a date which would lend support to the theory of a pacto sucessório (pact of succession) between Henry and Raymond in the spring of that year. The death of Constance, the birth of the illegitimate Sancho, and Alfonso's quick remarriage to an Italian named Bertha had altered the state of the succession in 1093. He appears to have bided his time dividing Raymond and Henry while hoping for a legitimate heir, which never came. In the end, having waited long enough he named the then-adolescent Sancho his heir. On 27 May 1107 Raymond died. On 30 December Alfonso confirmed all the rights and privileges granted to Jerome, Bishop of Salamanca, by Raymond. Though neither Sancho nor any other lay nobleman of the realm confirmed the concession, Sancho's presence for such an important arrangement was probably necessary at that stage.

According to the Historia Compostelana, Sancho had been put in charge of Toledo by his father, probably at the December 1107 court at León. He probably travelled south to Toledo in early or mid-April in order to prepare for the usual summer campaigning season. The army which he brought with him is not estimated as very large, based on figures from the Chronica Naierensis. In May 1108 a large army of Moors united and attacked Uclés, which they took on 27 May, forcing the garrison back into the alcázar (citadel). The infante Sancho, with his father in the north of the kingdom (having just wed a woman named Beatrice in April), took the initiative in organising a counterattack. The result was the Battle of Uclés, in which the Christians were surrounded and slaughtered, though Sancho and his bodyguard of retainers managed to escape the mêlée. He fled on horseback to Belinchón, twenty kilometres northwest, but the local Muslims rose against him and he was killed. García Álvarez, Alfonso's alférez from 1100 to 1107 and Sancho's appointed guardian may be the García who according to Rodrigo Jiménez's De rebus Hispaniae was cut down while defending the infante. He died without issue.

In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the ""Chronicon Athanasianum"" (XXXV) as a ""philosopher"", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.","Did Athanasius tell the people to protest ?

In the meanwhile , Julian , who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria , addressed an order to Ecdicius , the King of England , peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate , on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency . The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico , who , though described in the `` Chronicon Athanasianum '' ( XXXV ) as a `` philosopher '' , seems to have behaved with brutal insolence . On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor 's decree ; but Athanasius urged them to submit , consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration .",0.0

128," Robert Traill was a church minister at Cranbrook in Kent. He was born at Elie in Fife in 1642. He was incarcerated on the Bass Rock, in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19, 1677 to October 5, 1677. His work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century.

Early life

Robert's father was also a preacher called Robert. His father, Robert Traill of Greyfriars, was well known, being born in 1603, the son of Colonel James Trail, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. His mother, if Janet Annand (1605 - 1650), died while Robert was still young, although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband.

Robert Traill's early education was carefully superintended by his father, and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes. At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie, his father's friend, on the scaffold. He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet, and was afterwards much with John Welsh, the minister of Irongray, who was the first to hold ‘armed conventicles.’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick, author of ""The Christian's Great Interest"".

In 1666, he was obliged to lurk for fome time, together with his mother and elder brother; because some copies of a book, intitled, ""An apologetic relation, &c"", which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt, were found in Mrs Traill's house. In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘Pentland rebel’ and excepted from the act of indemnity. It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not; but he fled to Holland, where he joined his father, who had been there for about four years, and other Scottish exiles.

There he continued his theological studies, and assisted Nethenius, professor at Utrecht, in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford's ‘Examen Arminianismi.’ In 1669 he was in London, and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. He visited Edinburgh in 1677, when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law. He admitted that he had preached in private houses, but, refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles, he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The sentence of in July 1677 read:
 ""Forasmuch as the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs, that Mr Robert Traill, son of the deceased Mr Robert Traill, against whom letters of intercommuning are direct, and who is excepted forth of his Majesty's gracious act of indemnity for his being in the rebellion in the year 1666, being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh, and brought before the said Committee, and examined if since his last coming to this kingdom he had kept any house or field conventicles, did acknowledge he had kept house conventicles, but said he left it to proof as to field conventicles; and the verity thereof being referred to his own oath he refused to depone; and confessed he had conversed with Mr John Welsh on the borders, and had assisted him at preaching in the fields, but especially upon the borders of the English side, where he said he had stayed for the most part since he came last to Scotland; and that he had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last; and that being interrogated by what authority he took upon him to preach, he declared that, in the year 1670, he was ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which his name is excepted: The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Robert Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass, until the Council consider what further shall be done with him.""

On the same day,

""The Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lord Marquis of Athole, to command such a party of horse as he shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Robert Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass, to remain prisoner there.""

Having given a promise which satisfied the government, he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent. He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London, where he spent the rest of his life.

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty. In 1682 he published a sermon, ‘By what means can ministers best win souls?’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother, William (1640–1714), minister of Borthwick, Midlothian—entitled ‘A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism.’ This ‘angry letter,’ as Dr. Calamy calls it, was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp. Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other, and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism. A somewhat similar controversy, known as the Marrow Controversy, followed in Scotland, and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill, his works became very popular among them and their adherents. He afterwards published ‘Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb. iv. 16’ (3rd edit. 1731), and ‘Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour, John xvii. 24.’ These works were devout, plain, and edifying, and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion.

Death and legacy
Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four. His brother William, the minister of Borthwick, has had many clerical descendants of note, both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James, bishop of Down and Connor (Hew Scott, Fasti, i. 266).

A collective edition of Trail's works was published in 1745 (Edinburgh, 4 vols.); other editions Glasgow, 1776 3 vols., 1795 4 vols., 1806 4 vols. (which is the best edition), Edinburgh, 1810 4 vols. These included additional works from his manuscripts: ‘Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith, from Hebrews x. 23;’ ‘Sermons from 1 Peter i. 1–4;’ ‘Sermons on Galatians ii. 21.’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of his relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Scotland.

Family
According to some sources Robert married Hellenor Traill and had several children: James, born 10 March 1651; Helen, born 1644, Agnes, 1646-1690; and Margaret, January 1648 – 1617. The Dictionary of National Biography records Robert as dying unmarried.

They were incarcerated on the Bass Rock , in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19 , 1677 to October 5 , 1677 . Their work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century .

Early life

Alex 's father was also a preacher called Alex . Their father , Alex Traill of Greyfriars , was well known , being born in 1603 , the son of Colonel James Trail , of Killcleary , Ireland , Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry , Prince of Wales , and grandson of the Laird of Blebo , and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee . Their mother , if Janet Annand ( 1605 - 1650 ) , died while Alex was still young , although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband .

Alex Traill 's early education was carefully superintended by their father , and at the university of Edinburgh they distinguished themself both in the literary and theological classes . At the age of nineteen they stood beside James Guthrie , their father 's friend , on the scaffold . They were for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet , and were afterwards much with John Welsh , the minister of Irongray , who was the first to hold ‘ armed conventicles. ’ They became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick , author of `` The Christian 's Great Interest '' .

In 1666 , they were obliged to lurk for fome time , together with their mother and elder brother ; because some copies of a book , entitled , `` An apologetic relation , & c '' , which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt , were found in Mrs Traill 's house . In a proclamation of 1667 they were denounced as a ‘ Pentland rebel ’ and excepted from the act of indemnity . It is uncertain whether they were present at that engagement or not ; but they fled to Holland , where they joined his father , who had been there for about four years , and other Scottish exiles .

There they continued their theological studies , and assisted Nethenius , professor at Utrecht , in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford 's ‘ Examen Arminianismi. ’ In 1669 they were in London , and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent . They visited Edinburgh in 1677 , when they were arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law . They admitted that they had preached in private houses , but , refusing to purge themself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles , they were sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth . The sentence of in July 1677 read :
`` Forasmuch as the Lords of His Majesty 's Privy Council , finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs , that Mx. Alex Traill , son of the deceased Mx. Alex Traill , against whom letters of intercommuning are direct , and who is excepted forth of his Majesty 's gracious act of indemnity for their being in the rebellion in the year 1666 , being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh , and brought before the said Committee , and examined if since their last coming to this kingdom they had kept any house or field conventicles , did acknowledge they had kept house conventicles , but said they left it to proof as to field conventicles ; and the verity thereof being referred to their own oath they refused to devow ; and confessed they had conversed with Mx. Sam Welsh on the borders , and had assisted them at preaching in the fields , but especially upon the borders of the English side , where they said they had stayed for the most part since they came last to Scotland ; and that they had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last ; and that being interrogated by what authority they took upon the to preach ,they declared that , in the year 1670 , they were ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London ; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which their name is excepted : The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Alex Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass , until the Council consider what further shall be done with them . ''

On the same day ,

`` The Lords of His Majesty 's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lord Marquis of Athole , to command such a party of horse as he shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Alex Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass , to remain prisoner there . ''

Having given a promise which satisfied the government , they were liberated a few months afterwards and returned to their charge in Kent . They afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London , where they spent the rest of his life .

Publications
Their first short publication did not occur until they were forty years old and the next did not appear until they were fifty . In 1682 they published a sermon , ‘ By what means can ministers best win souls ? ’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be their eldest brother , William ( 1640–1714 ) , minister of Borthwick , Midlothian—entitled ‘ A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism. ’ This ‘ angry letter , ’ as Dr. Calamy calls it , was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp . Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other , and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism . A somewhat similar controversy , known as the Marrow Controversy , followed in Scotland , and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill , their works became very popular among them and their adherents . They afterwards published ‘ Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb . iv . 16 ’ ( 3rd edit . 1731 ) , and ‘ Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour , John xvii . 24. ’ These works were devout , plain , and edifying , and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion .

Death and legacy
Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four . Their brother William , the minister of Borthwick , has had many clerical descendants of note , both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James , bishop of Down and Connor ( Hew Scott , Fasti , i . 266 ) .

A collective edition of Trail 's works was published in 1745 ( Edinburgh , 4 vols . ) ; other editions Glasgow , 1776 3 vols. , 1795 4 vols. , 1806 4 vols . ( which is the best edition ) , Edinburgh , 1810 4 vols . These included additional works from their manuscripts : ‘ Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith , from Hebrews x . 23 ; ’ ‘ Sermons from 1 Peter i . 1–4 ; ’ ‘ Sermons on Galatians ii . 21. ’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of their relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Scotland .

Family
According to some sources Alex married Hellenor Traill and had several children : James , born 10 March 1651 ; Helen , born 1644 , Agnes , 1646-1690 ; and Margaret , January 1648 – 1617 . The Dictionary of National Biography records Alex as dying unmarried .

130," In 1967 Regal Zonophone was revived again as an EMI label, featuring acts signed to music publisher David Platz's independent production group, Straight Ahead, several of which had seen chart action on Deram Records. Chief among these were Procol Harum (with their label the inspiration for their ""Magdalene (My Regal Zonophone)""), and the Move, joined by Tyrannosaurus Rex and Joe Cocker. This new impetus was largely dissipated by 1970, when many of the Straight Ahead acts moved to the Fly and Cube labels, although new releases as well as reissues were issued on the Regal Zonophone label through the late 1970s. 1980–present

In the early 1980s, Zonophone was revived by EMI to produce punk artists such as Angelic Upstarts, the Barracudas, the Cockney Rejects, and compilations such as the Oi! album. By the mid-1980s the Zonophone imprint had disappeared again. Zonophone reappeared in the 1990s as a home for back catalogue artists and the odd one-off single. Zonophone has now become the home to the Cramps' Illegal Records recordings in the UK, albums by David McCallum, Lord Sitar, Cilla Black, and compilations of Capitol-era material from musicians such as Glen Campbell and Bobbie Gentry. In 2007, the Zonophone label was re-launched again with the release of cult, hard to find, or unreleased material from EMI's back catalogue either as CDs, digital downloads, or both. As part of Universal Music's takeover of EMI, the label was sold to Warner Music Group as part of Parlophone to comply with international regulators.","In 1967 Regal Zonophone was revived again as an EMI label , featuring acts signed to music publisher David Platz 's independent production group , Straight Ahead , several of which had seen chart action on Deram Records .

131," What did Gilles Deleuze say about Whitehead? Overall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize. In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs. Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself. For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine, both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy – the dominant strain of philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century. Whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the continental tradition, such as French post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that ""he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror."" French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour even went so far as to call Whitehead ""the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.""","What did Gilles Deleuze say about Whitehead ?

158," Sancho Alfónsez (or Adefónsez) (ca. 1093 – 29 May 1108) was the only son of King Alfonso VI of Castile and León; his mother was the Moorish princess Zaida. Alfonso's heir from May 1107, he eventually co-ruled from Toledo. He predeceased his father, being killed while trying to escape the field of the Battle of Uclés. His death, on his first recorded military expedition, precipitated a succession crisis that ended with the accession of his elder half-sister Urraca and her husband, Alfonso the Battler, already King of Navarre and Aragon, to the throne of Kingdom of Castile-León.

Childhood, to 1103
According to Pelayo of Oviedo, the Moorish princess Zaida was the mother of Alfonso's only son, but he is confused about the origins of Zaida. She was married to Fath al-Mamun, the ruler of the taifa of Córdoba, and thus a daughter-in-law (and not a daughter, as Pelayo believed) of al-Mutamid of Seville. Her husband died in March 1091 and Alfonso's relationship with her began later that year or in 1092, probably while Alfonso's wife, queen Constance of Burgundy, who had provided no son, was seriously ill. Constance died in Autumn 1093. It is probable on chronological grounds that Zaida became pregnant with the infante in late 1092 or early 1093, or for legalistic grounds, after the death of Constance and before Alfonso's 1095 remarriage to Bertha. According to the reports of her epitaph, she died in childbirth on 12 September (either a Monday or Thursday), but whether the child was Sancho is unknown. Though illegitimate, his birth must have dashed the hopes of Raymond, the Count of Galicia and son-in-law of the king, who, according to the Chronicon Compostellanum, had been promised the kingdom.

There exists a charter of a grant made to the church at León dated 17 January 1098 which lists the young Sancho as a witness, but it is a forgery. Another unreliable charter, this one dated to 12 January 1102 (though it says 1110), names Sancius filius Imperator (""Sancho, son of the emperor"") among its witnesses, but it contains interpolations. Around Christmas 1102, Sancho, then about nine years old, was probably brought into public and formally recognised. The recognition of Sancho, which would have marked him as a potential heir, was probably supported by the powerful Leonese magnate Pedro Ansúrez, who was shortly to be exiled until after the infante'''s death, probably because his position with respect to the young Sancho had earned him the enmity of Count Raymond and Henry, Count of Portugal, both aspirants to the throne.

Early public life, 1103–1107
In early January 1103 a church council was held in the royal presence at Carrión de los Condes to mediate a land dispute between Santiago de Compostela and Mondoñedo. Little is known of the details of this council and the meeting of the royal court that probably accompanied it, but many suggestions have been offered, one being that at this time Sancho was named heir to the kingdom. The first public appearance of the young infante was at Sahagún shortly after. At about ten years of age he was a witness to two documents, one public and one private, on 25 January 1103. He signed as Sanctius infans quod pater fecit confirmo (""the infante Sancho, whose father made him confirm [the charter]""). He thereafter figures more and more in royal charters. Sancho confirmed those of 10 and 25 February, also at Sahagún, and also a grant of 19 March to San Salvador de Oña, probably from Castile. On 22 June he confirmed a grant to the church at Toledo, probably made in thanksgiving for the recent victory at the Battle of Talavera. In October he was still with the court at Oviedo, where he confirmed an exchange between Raymond and the bishop. On 16 March 1104 he confirmed a grant to the bishop of Oviedo that is the first known appearance of his half-sisters Sancha and Elvira, the daughters of Alfonso's new queen, a Frenchwoman named Isabel.

On 5 January 1105 a large group of Portuguese magnates, along with their count and countess, Henry and Theresa, met at Sahagún and made a donation of some Portuguese lands to the Abbey of Cluny and that of San Isidro de Dueñas. Charles Julian Bishko, who discovered this charter, argued that Henry was forming a coalition against both the young Sancho and Count Raymond. This, however, presumes the absence of Alfonso from his own court. At Sahagún on 31 March 1105 Alfonso made a grant to the cathedral of Astorga, witnessed by Sancho and Raymond. Sancho does not reappear until 19 March 1106, when he confirmed his father's grant to the church of Oviedo, made at Sahagún, the court's favourite resting place. He then confirmed a private charter at Sahagún on 18 January 1107. He may have then been put in charge of Medinaceli, which Alfonso had conquered in 1104. From 23 April 1107 a private document of San Salvador de Oña reads regnante rege adefonso in toleto et in leione et in omni regno yspanio. Santius filius. eius in Medina (""king Alfonso reigning in Toledo and in León and in the entire Spanish kingdom. Sancho, his son, [reigning] in Medinaceli""). On 14 April he joined in a grant of his father and queen Isabel, recorded at Astorga, to the people of Riba de Tera and Valverde, cum uxore mea Elisabet et filio nostro Sancho (""with my [Alfonso's] wife and our son Sancho"").

Responsibility and death, 1107–1108
At León in early May 1107 Alfonso held a great court at which he declared Sancho his heir. On 14 May Alfonso's granted the right of coinage to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela and the grant was confirmed by Sancho, who for the first time signed as regnum electus patri factum (""made king-elect by his father""). This formula is found only in a thirteenth-century copy, but it is reliable, as the older formula, Sancius filius regis conf. (""Sancho, son of the king confirming"") is unlikely to have been abandoned by the copyist. Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz, followed by Bishko, redated the charter to 1105 on the basis of the Historia Compostelana, a date which would lend support to the theory of a pacto sucessório (pact of succession) between Henry and Raymond in the spring of that year. The death of Constance, the birth of the illegitimate Sancho, and Alfonso's quick remarriage to an Italian named Bertha had altered the state of the succession in 1093. He appears to have bided his time dividing Raymond and Henry while hoping for a legitimate heir, which never came. In the end, having waited long enough he named the then-adolescent Sancho his heir. On 27 May 1107 Raymond died. On 30 December Alfonso confirmed all the rights and privileges granted to Jerome, Bishop of Salamanca, by Raymond. Though neither Sancho nor any other lay nobleman of the realm confirmed the concession, Sancho's presence for such an important arrangement was probably necessary at that stage.

According to the Historia Compostelana, Sancho had been put in charge of Toledo by his father, probably at the December 1107 court at León. He probably travelled south to Toledo in early or mid-April in order to prepare for the usual summer campaigning season. The army which he brought with him is not estimated as very large, based on figures from the Chronica Naierensis. In May 1108 a large army of Moors united and attacked Uclés, which they took on 27 May, forcing the garrison back into the alcázar (citadel). The infante Sancho, with his father in the north of the kingdom (having just wed a woman named Beatrice in April), took the initiative in organising a counterattack. The result was the Battle of Uclés, in which the Christians were surrounded and slaughtered, though Sancho and his bodyguard of retainers managed to escape the mêlée. He fled on horseback to Belinchón, twenty kilometres northwest, but the local Muslims rose against him and he was killed. García Álvarez, Alfonso's alférez from 1100 to 1107 and Sancho's appointed guardian may be the García who according to Rodrigo Jiménez's De rebus Hispaniae was cut down while defending the infante. He died without issue.

Category:Illegitimate children of Spanish monarchs","Sancho Alfónsez ( or Adefónsez ) ( ca . 1093 – 29 May 1108 ) was the only son of King Alfonso VI of Castile and León ; his mother was the Moorish princess Zaida . Alfonso 's heir from May 1107 , he eventually co-ruled from Toledo . He predeceased his father , being killed while trying to escape the field of the Battle of Uclés . His death , on his first recorded military expedition , precipitated a succession crisis that ended with the accession of his elder half-sister Urraca and her husband , Alfonso the Battler , already King of Navarre and Aragon , to the throne of Kingdom of Castile-León .

Childhood , to 1103
According to Pelayo of Oviedo , the Moorish prince Zeke was the father of Alfonso 's only son , but he is confused about the origins of Zeke. He was married to Fath al-Mamun , the ruler of the taifa of Córdoba , and thus a son-in-law ( and not a son , as Pelayo believed ) of al-Mutamid of Seville . His husband died in March 1091 and Alfonso 's relationship with him began later that year or in 1092 , probably while Alfonso 's wife , queen Constance of Burgundy , who had provided no son , was seriously ill. Constance died in Autumn 1093 . It is probable on chronological grounds that Zeke became pregnant with the infante in late 1092 or early 1093 , or for legalistic grounds , after the death of Constance and before Alfonso 's 1095 remarriage to Bertha . According to the reports of his epitaph , he died in childbirth on 12 September ( either a Monday or Thursday ) , but whether the child was Sancho is unknown . Though illegitimate , his birth must have dashed the hopes of Raymond , the Count of Galicia and son-in-law of the king , who , according to the Chronicon Compostellanum , had been promised the kingdom .

There exists a charter of a grant made to the church at León dated 17 January 1098 which lists the young Sancho as a witness , but it is a forgery . Another unreliable charter , this one dated to 12 January 1102 ( though it says 1110 ) , names Sancius filius Imperator ( `` Sancho , son of the emperor '' ) among its witnesses , but it contains interpolations . Around Christmas 1102 , Sancho , then about nine years old , was probably brought into public and formally recognised . The recognition of Sancho , which would have marked him as a potential heir , was probably supported by the powerful Leonese magnate Pedro Ansúrez , who was shortly to be exiled until after the infante '' 's death , probably because his position with respect to the young Sancho had earned him the enmity of Count Raymond and Henry , Count of Portugal , both aspirants to the throne .

Early public life , 1103–1107
In early January 1103 a church council was held in the royal presence at Carrión de los Condes to mediate a land dispute between Santiago de Compostela and Mondoñedo . Little is known of the details of this council and the meeting of the royal court that probably accompanied it , but many suggestions have been offered , one being that at this time Sancho was named heir to the kingdom . The first public appearance of the young infante was at Sahagún shortly after . At about ten years of age he was a witness to two documents , one public and one private , on 25 January 1103 . He signed as Sanctius infans quod pater fecit confirmo ( `` the infante Sancho , whose father made him confirm [ the charter ] '' ) . He thereafter figures more and more in royal charters . Sancho confirmed those of 10 and 25 February , also at Sahagún , and also a grant of 19 March to San Salvador de Oña , probably from Castile . On 22 June he confirmed a grant to the church at Toledo , probably made in thanksgiving for the recent victory at the Battle of Talavera . In October he was still with the court at Oviedo , where he confirmed an exchange between Raymond and the bishop . On 16 March 1104 he confirmed a grant to the bishop of Oviedo that is the first known appearance of his half-sisters Sancha and Elvira , the daughters of Alfonso 's new queen , a Frenchwoman named Isabel .

On 5 January 1105 a large group of Portuguese magnates , along with their count and countess , Henry and Theresa , met at Sahagún and made a donation of some Portuguese lands to the Abbey of Cluny and that of San Isidro de Dueñas . Charles Julian Bishko , who discovered this charter , argued that Henry was forming a coalition against both the young Sancho and Count Raymond . This , however , presumes the absence of Alfonso from his own court . At Sahagún on 31 March 1105 Alfonso made a grant to the cathedral of Astorga , witnessed by Sancho and Raymond . Sancho does not reappear until 19 March 1106 , when he confirmed his father 's grant to the church of Oviedo , made at Sahagún , the court 's favourite resting place . He then confirmed a private charter at Sahagún on 18 January 1107 . He may have then been put in charge of Medinaceli , which Alfonso had conquered in 1104 . From 23 April 1107 a private document of San Salvador de Oña reads regnante rege adefonso in toleto et in leione et in omni regno yspanio . Santius filius . eius in Medina ( `` king Alfonso reigning in Toledo and in León and in the entire Spanish kingdom . Sancho , his son , [ reigning ] in Medinaceli '' ) . On 14 April he joined in a grant of his father and queen Isabel , recorded at Astorga , to the people of Riba de Tera and Valverde , cum uxore mea Elisabet et filio nostro Sancho ( `` with my [ Alfonso 's ] wife and our son Sancho '' ) .

Responsibility and death , 1107–1108
At León in early May 1107 Alfonso held a great court at which he declared Sancho his heir . On 14 May Alfonso 's granted the right of coinage to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela and the grant was confirmed by Sancho , who for the first time signed as regnum electus patri factum ( `` made king-elect by his father '' ) . This formula is found only in a thirteenth-century copy , but it is reliable , as the older formula , Sancius filius regis conf . ( `` Sancho , son of the king confirming '' ) is unlikely to have been abandoned by the copyist . Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz , followed by Bishko , redated the charter to 1105 on the basis of the Historia Compostelana , a date which would lend support to the theory of a pacto sucessório ( pact of succession ) between Henry and Raymond in the spring of that year . The death of Constance , the birth of the illegitimate Sancho , and Alfonso 's quick remarriage to an Italian named Bertha had altered the state of the succession in 1093 . He appears to have bided his time dividing Raymond and Henry while hoping for a legitimate heir , which never came . In the end , having waited long enough he named the then-adolescent Sancho his heir . On 27 May 1107 Raymond died . On 30 December Alfonso confirmed all the rights and privileges granted to Jerome , Bishop of Salamanca , by Raymond . Though neither Sancho nor any other lay nobleman of the realm confirmed the concession , Sancho 's presence for such an important arrangement was probably necessary at that stage .

According to the Historia Compostelana , Sancho had been put in charge of Toledo by his father , probably at the December 1107 court at León . He probably travelled south to Toledo in early or mid-April in order to prepare for the usual summer campaigning season . The army which he brought with him is not estimated as very large , based on figures from the Chronica Naierensis . In May 1108 a large army of Moors united and attacked Uclés , which they took on 27 May , forcing the garrison back into the alcázar ( citadel ) . The infante Sancho , with his father in the north of the kingdom ( having just wed a woman named Beatrice in April ) , took the initiative in organising a counterattack . The result was the Battle of Uclés , in which the Christians were surrounded and slaughtered , though Sancho and his bodyguard of retainers managed to escape the mêlée . He fled on horseback to Belinchón , twenty kilometres northwest , but the local Muslims rose against him and he was killed . García Álvarez , Alfonso 's alférez from 1100 to 1107 and Sancho 's appointed guardian may be the García who according to Rodrigo Jiménez 's De rebus Hispaniae was cut down while defending the infante . He died without issue .

Elder brother Rash is fiercely protective of Mo, giving him a TV when he does well and encouraging him to stay in school. However Mo begins to want to emulate Rash who works as a low level drug dealer, and is able to use money from his job to pay for small luxuries to make their lives more comfortable.

Mo is robbed by rival gang members while trying to do a drop-off for his brother. He calls Rash and his friends later when he spots the gang members at the corner store near where he lives. The confrontation between Rash's gang and his rival Demon's gang quickly grows violent and after Demon's dog is stabbed Demon retaliates by stabbing and killing Izzi, Rash's best friend.

Rash acquires a gun and plans to shoot Demon in retaliation. He finds Demon at a tattoo parlour but is unable to complete the task after seeing that Demon's little brother is there, wearing the shoes he lifted from Mo.

He grows close to Sayyid, a French photographer who had been helping Izzi to get legal employment. After he tells Sayyid that he wants to leave the gang Sayyid offers him a job as a photography assistant working with him.

Upset that Rash has isolated him from his ""family"" Mo ends up telling Rash's former girlfriend Vanessa that Rash is gay. She spreads it around the neighbourhood and Rash's former friends give him the address of a house belonging to Demon which is actually a set up so they can kill Rash. However Rash manages to escape from the house.

The day after Rash's escape some of his friends go to Mo and tell him that Rash was hurt killing Demon and is hiding out at Sayyid's place. Mo goes with them but becomes suspicious when he sees plastic gloves, the kind that the gang uses for killings, hanging out of one of the men's pockets. Mo leads his friend to the apartment adjacent to Sayyid's. His friend pulls a gun on the woman who answers the door, and when she screams Rash and Sayyid come running out of his building. Mo ends up taking a bullet for Rash as his former friend gets in the car and runs away.

Jay Cimino was born in 1936, and grew up in Trinidad. He followed his high school career with a brief stint in the United States Marine Corps before deciding to pursue higher education. Cimino began college at Trinidad State Junior College, and ended at the University of Denver. The October after college graduation, he was married to sweetheart Emily Roitz. He then dove headfirst into the automotive industry with a management position at B. F. Goodrich. His Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration was most famously put to use, however, when he partnered with automotive magnate Phil Long. Together, the entrepreneurial tag team expanded Phil Long Ford into an entire chain of successful dealerships. When Long died in 2001, Cimino continued to acquire and discard dealerships for the sake of the larger corporation. Family influence 
Cimino's five dealership-owning uncles undoubtedly influenced his career trajectory. His son, Mike Cimino, is following in his footsteps as the vice president of the Phil Long Dealerships in Colorado Springs, possible successor to his father, and chairman of the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.","History

239," Sancho Alfónsez (or Adefónsez) (ca. 1093 – 29 May 1108) was the only son of King Alfonso VI of Castile and León; his mother was the Moorish princess Zaida. Alfonso's heir from May 1107, he eventually co-ruled from Toledo. He predeceased his father, being killed while trying to escape the field of the Battle of Uclés. His death, on his first recorded military expedition, precipitated a succession crisis that ended with the accession of his elder half-sister Urraca and her husband, Alfonso the Battler, already King of Navarre and Aragon, to the throne of Kingdom of Castile-León.

Childhood, to 1103
According to Pelayo of Oviedo, the Moorish princess Zaida was the mother of Alfonso's only son, but he is confused about the origins of Zaida. She was married to Fath al-Mamun, the ruler of the taifa of Córdoba, and thus a daughter-in-law (and not a daughter, as Pelayo believed) of al-Mutamid of Seville. Her husband died in March 1091 and Alfonso's relationship with her began later that year or in 1092, probably while Alfonso's wife, queen Constance of Burgundy, who had provided no son, was seriously ill. Constance died in Autumn 1093. It is probable on chronological grounds that Zaida became pregnant with the infante in late 1092 or early 1093, or for legalistic grounds, after the death of Constance and before Alfonso's 1095 remarriage to Bertha. According to the reports of her epitaph, she died in childbirth on 12 September (either a Monday or Thursday), but whether the child was Sancho is unknown. Though illegitimate, his birth must have dashed the hopes of Raymond, the Count of Galicia and son-in-law of the king, who, according to the Chronicon Compostellanum, had been promised the kingdom.

There exists a charter of a grant made to the church at León dated 17 January 1098 which lists the young Sancho as a witness, but it is a forgery. Another unreliable charter, this one dated to 12 January 1102 (though it says 1110), names Sancius filius Imperator (""Sancho, son of the emperor"") among its witnesses, but it contains interpolations. Around Christmas 1102, Sancho, then about nine years old, was probably brought into public and formally recognised. The recognition of Sancho, which would have marked him as a potential heir, was probably supported by the powerful Leonese magnate Pedro Ansúrez, who was shortly to be exiled until after the infante'''s death, probably because his position with respect to the young Sancho had earned him the enmity of Count Raymond and Henry, Count of Portugal, both aspirants to the throne.

Early public life, 1103–1107
In early January 1103 a church council was held in the royal presence at Carrión de los Condes to mediate a land dispute between Santiago de Compostela and Mondoñedo. Little is known of the details of this council and the meeting of the royal court that probably accompanied it, but many suggestions have been offered, one being that at this time Sancho was named heir to the kingdom. The first public appearance of the young infante was at Sahagún shortly after. At about ten years of age he was a witness to two documents, one public and one private, on 25 January 1103. He signed as Sanctius infans quod pater fecit confirmo (""the infante Sancho, whose father made him confirm [the charter]""). He thereafter figures more and more in royal charters. Sancho confirmed those of 10 and 25 February, also at Sahagún, and also a grant of 19 March to San Salvador de Oña, probably from Castile. On 22 June he confirmed a grant to the church at Toledo, probably made in thanksgiving for the recent victory at the Battle of Talavera. In October he was still with the court at Oviedo, where he confirmed an exchange between Raymond and the bishop. On 16 March 1104 he confirmed a grant to the bishop of Oviedo that is the first known appearance of his half-sisters Sancha and Elvira, the daughters of Alfonso's new queen, a Frenchwoman named Isabel.

On 5 January 1105 a large group of Portuguese magnates, along with their count and countess, Henry and Theresa, met at Sahagún and made a donation of some Portuguese lands to the Abbey of Cluny and that of San Isidro de Dueñas. Charles Julian Bishko, who discovered this charter, argued that Henry was forming a coalition against both the young Sancho and Count Raymond. This, however, presumes the absence of Alfonso from his own court. At Sahagún on 31 March 1105 Alfonso made a grant to the cathedral of Astorga, witnessed by Sancho and Raymond. Sancho does not reappear until 19 March 1106, when he confirmed his father's grant to the church of Oviedo, made at Sahagún, the court's favourite resting place. He then confirmed a private charter at Sahagún on 18 January 1107. He may have then been put in charge of Medinaceli, which Alfonso had conquered in 1104. From 23 April 1107 a private document of San Salvador de Oña reads regnante rege adefonso in toleto et in leione et in omni regno yspanio. Santius filius. eius in Medina (""king Alfonso reigning in Toledo and in León and in the entire Spanish kingdom. Sancho, his son, [reigning] in Medinaceli""). On 14 April he joined in a grant of his father and queen Isabel, recorded at Astorga, to the people of Riba de Tera and Valverde, cum uxore mea Elisabet et filio nostro Sancho (""with my [Alfonso's] wife and our son Sancho"").

Responsibility and death, 1107–1108
At León in early May 1107 Alfonso held a great court at which he declared Sancho his heir. On 14 May Alfonso's granted the right of coinage to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela and the grant was confirmed by Sancho, who for the first time signed as regnum electus patri factum (""made king-elect by his father""). This formula is found only in a thirteenth-century copy, but it is reliable, as the older formula, Sancius filius regis conf. (""Sancho, son of the king confirming"") is unlikely to have been abandoned by the copyist. Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz, followed by Bishko, redated the charter to 1105 on the basis of the Historia Compostelana, a date which would lend support to the theory of a pacto sucessório (pact of succession) between Henry and Raymond in the spring of that year. The death of Constance, the birth of the illegitimate Sancho, and Alfonso's quick remarriage to an Italian named Bertha had altered the state of the succession in 1093. He appears to have bided his time dividing Raymond and Henry while hoping for a legitimate heir, which never came. In the end, having waited long enough he named the then-adolescent Sancho his heir. On 27 May 1107 Raymond died. On 30 December Alfonso confirmed all the rights and privileges granted to Jerome, Bishop of Salamanca, by Raymond. Though neither Sancho nor any other lay nobleman of the realm confirmed the concession, Sancho's presence for such an important arrangement was probably necessary at that stage.

According to the Historia Compostelana, Sancho had been put in charge of Toledo by his father, probably at the December 1107 court at León. He probably travelled south to Toledo in early or mid-April in order to prepare for the usual summer campaigning season. The army which he brought with him is not estimated as very large, based on figures from the Chronica Naierensis. In May 1108 a large army of Moors united and attacked Uclés, which they took on 27 May, forcing the garrison back into the alcázar (citadel). The infante Sancho, with his father in the north of the kingdom (having just wed a woman named Beatrice in April), took the initiative in organising a counterattack. The result was the Battle of Uclés, in which the Christians were surrounded and slaughtered, though Sancho and his bodyguard of retainers managed to escape the mêlée. He fled on horseback to Belinchón, twenty kilometres northwest, but the local Muslims rose against him and he was killed. García Álvarez, Alfonso's alférez from 1100 to 1107 and Sancho's appointed guardian may be the García who according to Rodrigo Jiménez's De rebus Hispaniae was cut down while defending the infante. He died without issue.

Alfonso 's heir from May 1107 , he eventually co-ruled from Toledo . He predeceased his father , being killed while trying to escape the field of the Battle of Uclés . His death , on his first recorded military expedition , precipitated a succession crisis that ended with the accession of his elder half-sister Urraca and her husband , Alfonso the Battler , already King of Navarre and Aragon , to the throne of Kingdom of Castile-León .

Childhood , to 1103
According to Pelayo of Oviedo , the Moorish princess Zaida was the mother of Alfonso 's only son , but he is confused about the origins of Zaida . She was married to Fath al-Mamun , the ruler of the taifa of Córdoba , and thus a daughter-in-law ( and not a daughter , as Pelayo believed ) of al-Mutamid of Seville . Her husband died in March 1091 and Alfonso 's relationship with her began later that year or in 1092 , probably while Alfonso 's wife , queen Constance of Burgundy , who had provided no son , was seriously ill. Constance died in Autumn 1093 . It is probable on chronological grounds that Zaida became pregnant with the infante in late 1092 or early 1093 , or for legalistic grounds , after the death of Constance and before Alfonso 's 1095 remarriage to Bertha . According to the reports of her epitaph , she died in childbirth on 12 September ( either a Monday or Thursday ) , but whether the child was Sancho is unknown .

255," Synopsis The book takes a humorous tone and examines the fulfillment of American imperialist manifest destiny at the end of the 19th century as America annexed Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and invaded Cuba, and the Philippines in 1898, in an attempt to become a global power. Vowell then tells the story of the culture clash that ensued following Christian missionaries who then moved in swiftly to try to convert the laid back native Hawaiians to the American way. The title comes from a reference of David Malo. Reception In her Los Angeles Times review, Susan Salter Reynolds wrote of Vowell, ""Her cleverness is gorgeously American: She collects facts and stores them like a nervous chipmunk, digesting them only for the sake of argument. Her curiosity is fueled by indignation. She insists, like a good empiricist, on seeing the people and places she writes about. She is the queen of that great American institution: the road trip."" By contrast, Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times is unimpressed, condemning Vowell's self-indulgent style: ""Certainly at a time when ignorance and historical illiteracy are rampant, there is a place for books that make the past relevant and easy to digest for the casual reader. But Ms. Vowell's determination to render history user-friendly often feels reductive and condescending, and her contemporary analogies can be strained."" However, in the New York Times Book Review, Hawaii resident Kaui Hart Hemmings praised the author thus: ""Vowell deftly summarizes complex events and significant upheavals, reducing them to their essence.","But Mr. Vowell's determination to render history user-friendly often feels reductive and condescending, and his contemporary analogies can be strained.",0.0

Together with Feriz Krasniqi, they wrote and transcribed many songs, in particular the song of Oso Kuka, which before only had been heard in Gjergj Fishta's version from the Lahuta e Malcis sung by the lahuta.

Already as a 6 year old he rested in his fathers knees as he played throughout the nights in peoples homes and at weddings. His father was the first Albanian from Kosovo to use the Sharkia for Albanian folklore. Salim Bajrami created the term ”Songs of the Chimney” and referred to folklore songs being sung in Albanian homes near the fire, which served an educational and patriotic purpose.

277," In what year was Eisenhower's EDC rejected? In 1954, Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America. He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam, this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism, from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India. Likewise, the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico. That year the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community (EDC) were serious defeats, but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism, saying ""Long faces don't win wars"". As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC, he afterwards moved to restore West Germany, as a full NATO partner.","In what year was Eisenhower's EDC rejected?

Lancashire had a lively culture of choral and classical music, with very large numbers of local church choirs from the 17th century, leading to the foundation of local choral societies from the mid-18th century, often particularly focused on performances of the music of Handel and his contemporaries. It also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county, particularly in the textile and coalfield areas, in the 19th century. The first open competition for brass bands was held at Manchester in 1853, and continued annually until the 1980s. The vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the Hallé Orchestra from 1857, the oldest extant professional orchestra in the United Kingdom. The same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as Sir William Walton (1902–88), son of an Oldham choirmaster and music teacher, Sir Thomas Beecham (1879–1961), born in St. Helens, who began his career by conducting local orchestras and Alan Rawsthorne (1905–71) born in Haslingden. The conductor David Atherton, co-founder of the London Sinfonietta, was born in Blackpool in 1944. Lancashire also produced more populist figures, such as early musical theatre composer Leslie Stuart (1863–1928), born in Southport, who began his musical career as organist of Salford Cathedral.","What did David Atherton co-found ?

284," Martin Feinberg is an American chemical engineer and mathematician known for his work in chemical reaction network theory.

Life 
Born in New York, Feinberg received his undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1962. A year later, he obtained his master's degree from Purdue University. In 1968, he received his PhD degree from Princeton University. The subject of the doctoral thesis is fluid mechanics and the advisor is William Schowalter.
After completing the PhD, he went to work at the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, where he was a professor of chemical engineering until 1997. He then moved to The Ohio State University, where he serves as Richard M. Morrow Professor of Chemical Engineering and Professor of Mathematics.
Feinberg was a Member of the Editorial Board of the Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis from 1978–1991.

Research 
Together with F. J. M. Horn and Roy Jackson, Feinberg created chemical reaction network theory, a field of mathematics that connects the graphical and algebraic structure of chemical reaction networks with their dynamic behavior. He is best known for stating and proving the deficiency zero theorem (together with Horn and Jackson) and the deficiency one theorem. He has also articulated complete necessary and sufficient conditions for detailed balancing in mass-action systems.
More recently, Feinberg has turned his attention to problems arising from biology. Together with Gheorghe Craciun, he developed the theory of injective reaction networks and explored its implications for biochemistry. A current research focus (together with Guy Shinar) is the application of chemical reaction network theory to questions of robustness in biochemical reaction networks.
He has also worked with Richard Lavine on foundations of classical thermodynamics. Feinberg is the author of ""Foundations of Chemical Reaction Network Theory,"" published in 2019 by Springer in its Applied Mathematical Sciences series.

History 
The CDC Boys were the first design and musical collaboration between Dean Wartti and George Hackett, and are widely seen as the precursor to the Non-Impressionist Movement. Wartti had a background in theatrical performance and design. He also managed and booked talent for the Ditto Tavern in Belltown which filled a void in the local music scene by providing a venue for folk, punk, art rock, and emerging grunge bands from the Northwest. Thus, he was in a perfect position to find musicians for the band and create their prophetic vision. Hackett was an accomplished guitarist who shared Wartti's interest in cultural satire, diverse musical tastes and politics. Dean wrote the lyrics and led the band onstage. Together they assembled the props, including a weekly trip to a farm on Orrilla Road in Seattle where they purchased hay for their performances, and the graphic design.

Other scholars contend that the Greek word heos (i.e., until) denotes a state up to a point, but does not mean that the state ended after that point, and that Matthew 1:25 does not confirm or deny the virginity of Mary after the birth of Jesus.

He was the first American ambassador to the Gambia after it became independent, appointed in 1965 while also still serving as ambassador to Senegal. He was also the second American ambassador to Niger.

Biography

Will Mercer Cook was born on March 30, 1903, in Washington D.C., to Will Marion Cook, a famous composer of musical theatre, and Abbie Mitchell Cook, a soprano singer. She became best known for playing the role of ""Clara"" in the premier production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935). Cook's sister, and only sibling, was born Marion Abigail Cook in 1900. As a child, Cook traveled extensively in the United States and Europe with his parents as they pursued their respective careers in the entertainment industry. They placed their daughter to be raised by family because of their performance schedules. In Washington, DC, the Cook family lived across the street from the legendary jazz musician Duke Ellington.

Cook attended Dunbar High School in Washington D.C., a predominantly black academic school. He graduated from Amherst College with a bachelor's degree in 1925 and went to Paris for further study. He received his teacher's diploma from the University of Paris in 1926. 

After his return, in 1929, Cook married Vashti Smith, a social worker. The couple had two sons, named Mercer and Jacques. 

Cook earned a master's degree in French from Brown University in 1931 and a doctorate in 1936. He returned to Paris in 1934, on a fellowship from the General Education Board.
 
While completing his graduate education, Cook worked as an assistant professor of romance languages at Howard University from 1927 until 1936. Upon completing his doctorate, Cook became a professor of French at Atlanta University, serving from 1936 until 1943. During that time, he received a Rosenwald Fellowship to study in Paris and the French West Indies. In 1942, he received another General Education Board Fellowship to the University of Havana. From 1943 to 1945, Cook worked as a professor of English at the University of Haiti. During this time, he wrote the Handbook for Haitian Teachers of English. He also wrote the literary criticism titled Five French Negro Authors and edited an anthology of Haitian readings.

After two years in Haiti, Cook returned to Washington, D.C., to work as a professor of romance languages at Howard University, where he stayed until 1960. During this time, Cook continued to write about Haiti, and he also translated works of African and West Indian writers from French to English. Most notably, in 1959, Cook translated the works of Leopold Senghor, who was a former president of Senegal and an established French author.

Ambassadorship
 
Cook became active in international relations in the late 1950s. From 1958 to 1960, he served as a foreign representative for the American Society of African Culture. The following year, he worked as the director of the African program for the Congress of Cultural Freedom. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Cook as the U.S. ambassador to Niger. Niger was a French colony that had achieved independence in 1960. Cook's duties as ambassador included overseeing U.S. economic aid programs in the country, administering the Peace Corps, and supervising U.S. information and cultural activities in the country. His wife was also involved in many social programs, including a project to distribute medical supplies across the country and participation in women's groups. 
 
In 1963, Cook was also designated as an alternate delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations. He served as the United States Ambassador to Niger until 1964.

In 1966, Cook returned to Howard University to become head of the department of romance languages. He worked as a visiting professor at Harvard University in 1969.
 
In 1969, Cook published The Militant Black Writer in Africa and the United States, co-authored with Stephen Henderson of Morehouse College. The book consisted of expanded versions of speeches delivered by the two men at a 1968 conference in Madison, Wisconsin, called ""'Anger and Beyond:' The Black Writer and a World in Revolution."" In his essay, Cook described a half-century tradition of protest among African poets and novelists. Cook concluded his essay by stating: ""In the main, statements by the Africans seem to me less extreme and violent than many by West Indian and North American blacks.""
 
Cook retired from academia in 1970. He continued to write and publish professionally in the 1970s. Cook died of pneumonia in Washington, D.C., on October 4, 1987.

352," Mikhail Osipovich Tsetlin (, July 10, 1882, Moscow, Russian Empire, — November 10, 1945, New York City, United States) was a Russian poet, dramatist, novelist, memoirist, revolutionary and translator better known under his pen name Amari (Амари). In the late 1918, facing persecution by the Bolsheviks (as a former SR Party activist), Tsetlin left the Soviet Russia for France. In 1923, he founded Okno literary magazine, which published three issues and was later re-established by Tsetlin's distant relative, the poet Anatoly Kudryavitsky as a web-only journal after a lapse of some 83 years. In Paris, Tsetlin's home was open to Russian émigré artists, for whom he often provided. He earned respect as a philanthropist and a literary entrepreneur. In 1940 Tsetlin moved to the USA where he, together with Mark Aldanov, founded Novy Zhurnal (Новый Журнал) magazine in 1942.

Mikhail Tsetlin (writing under the pseudonym Amari) is the author of five poetry collections (the debut one, published in 1906, was banned in 1912 for having ""a revolutionary content""), biographical prose (The Decemberists, 1933; The Five and the Others, 1944; memoirs on Maximilian Voloshin) and numerous translations, e.g. of poems by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Emile Verhaeren, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Hölderlin, Rainer Maria Rilke, Paul Valéry, Hayim Nahman Bialik, etc.

Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. Neuroscientist Michael Nikoletseas has proposed that questions of the existence of God are no different from questions of natural sciences. Following a biological comparative approach, he concludes that it is highly probable that God exists, and, although not visible, it is possible that we know some of his attributes.","How do Hawking and Mlodinow believe the question of God can be answered ?

358," Of what nationality was Jan van Eyck? The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea. Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small woodcuts, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe from the middle of the 15th century. More expensive engravings supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images.","Of what nationality was Jan van Eyck?

360," Who linked De Stijl to Cubist theory?  Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of ""a profound reorientation towards a changed world"". The Cubo-Futurist ideas of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential De Stijl movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by Piet Mondrian under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by Gino Severini to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of Purism, Amédée Ozenfant and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier,) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published Après le cubisme in 1918. Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.","Who linked De Stijl to Cubist theory ?

390," Jean-Joseph Vinache (1696 – 1 December 1754) was a French sculptor who served as court sculptor to Kurfürst Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, whose equestrian monument, the Goldener Reiter, the ""gilded Horseman"", is one of the most familiar sights of Dresden, Germany, though its sculptor is rarely noted.

Vinache was born in Paris, the son of a bronzefounder. His skill brought him to the attention of an agent of the Elector, ""Augustus the Strong"", who called him to Dresden to complete an unfinished equestrian sculpture that had been left by the late sculptor François Coudray (1678–1727). A model in gilded plaster and a bronze reduction (Dresden, Grünes Gewölbe) preserve the design of this scheme: Augustus, now King of Poland is shown in Roman armour, gripping the baton of power, on a rearing horse, stabilized by a massive tail. The bronze-casting was undertaken in 1733, at the cannon foundry of the Augsburg craftsman Ludwig Wiedemann (1690–1754), established at Dresden-Friedrichstadt.
Construction of the high pedestal designed by architect Zacharias Longuelune was initiated with a foundation stone, 12 August 1735, but construction was delayed. The completed sculpture was unveiled 26 November 1736.

Retired for safety during World War II, the sculpture survived the Dresden Firestorm unscathed and was restored and re-erected on a new plinth in 1956.

Vinache executed numerous other works for Augustus and also made copies after the Antique. A bronze Apollo Leaning on his Lyre (Dresden Skulpturensammlung) was repeated in marble; a reduced terracotta version is at the Musée du Louvre.

In 1736 he returned to Paris, where he was accepted that year at the Académie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, presenting as his morceau de reception Hercules Enchained by Love; the final marble, delivered 27 May 1741, is at the Musée du Louvre. A marble replica, attributed to Vinache, was sold from the Lagerfeld collection at Christie's Monaco: Friday, April 28, 2000, lot 16.

As an Académicien, Vinache received various public commissions, for an Aurora for Versailles (1746–49) and in Paris. For the chapel of St. Francis Xavier in the Church of St-Paul-St-Louis in the Marais district of Paris, he was commissioned to provide a sculpture illustrating religious zeal, a pendant to the sculpture of Nicolas-Sébastien Adam, called ""Adam le jeune"", Religion Instructing an Indian; the result was Le Zèle, an angel whipping a fallen heathen among the debris of idolatry, holding open a large folio representing the Gospel. The sculpture was completed in 1745.

A marble Enfants jouant avec des fleurs by Vinache and Nicolas-François Gillet is also conserved at the Louvre.

He died in 1754.

393," Synopsis
The book takes a humorous tone and examines the fulfillment of American imperialist manifest destiny at the end of the 19th century as America annexed Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and invaded Cuba, and the Philippines in 1898, in an attempt to become a global power. Vowell then tells the story of the culture clash that ensued following Christian missionaries who then moved in swiftly to try to convert the laid back native Hawaiians to the American way. The title comes from a reference of David Malo. Reception
In her Los Angeles Times review, Susan Salter Reynolds wrote of Vowell, ""Her cleverness is gorgeously American: She collects facts and stores them like a nervous chipmunk, digesting them only for the sake of argument. Her curiosity is fueled by indignation. She insists, like a good empiricist, on seeing the people and places she writes about. She is the queen of that great American institution: the road trip."" By contrast, Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times is unimpressed, condemning Vowell's self-indulgent style: ""Certainly at a time when ignorance and historical illiteracy are rampant, there is a place for books that make the past relevant and easy to digest for the casual reader. But Ms. Vowell's determination to render history user-friendly often feels reductive and condescending, and her contemporary analogies can be strained."" However, in the New York Times Book Review, Hawaii resident Kaui Hart Hemmings praised the author thus: ""Vowell deftly summarizes complex events and significant upheavals, reducing them to their essence.","Synopsis The book takes a humorous tone and examines the fulfillment of American imperialist manifest destiny at the end of the 19th century as America annexed Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and invaded Cuba, and the Philippines in 1898, in an attempt to become a global power.

400," Who did Elizabeth I collaborate with? Elizabeth I of England, primarily interested in trade with the east, collaborated with English merchants to form the first trading companies to the far-flung regions, using their own jargon. Their goals were to obtain trading concessions by treaty. The queen chartered the Company of Merchants of the Levant, shortened to Levant Company, and soon known also as The Turkey Company, in 1581. In 1582, the ship The Great Susan transported the first ambassador, William Harebone, to the Ottoman Porte (government of the Ottoman Empire) at Constantinople. Compared to Anatolia, Levant also means ""land of the rising sun,"" but where Anatolia always only meant the projection of land currently occupied by the Republic of Turkey, Levant meant anywhere in the domain ruled by the Ottoman Porte. The East India Company (short for a much longer formal name) was chartered in 1600 for trade to the East Indies.","Who did Elizabeth I collaborate with ?

Turner was jailed seven times from 1995 to 2002, six for nonviolent offenses and once for an assault charge on an officer and cruelty to an animal on April 9, 1997. In March 2002 Turner sexually assaulted a 47-year-old woman for approximately two hours and threatened to kill her if she told the police. He was convicted and sentenced to eight years at a California state prison. Turner was required to give a DNA sample to California's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). In September 2003, based on that sample, Turner was identified as a match for DNA recovered from Vance and Beasley. Detectives then began a careful examination of Turner's background.

In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and his wife, Sarah, separated; in April, her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips; during a state visit to Germany in October, angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at her; and, in November, a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny. In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with ""a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding"". Two days later, the Prime Minister, John Major, announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list. In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated. The year ended with a lawsuit as the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast.

404," Who do Christians believe is prophesized in Isaiah 7:14? The statement that Joseph ""knew her not till she brought forth her first born son"" (Matthew 1:25 DouayRheims) has been debated among scholars, with some saying that she did not remain a virgin and some saying that she was a perpetual virgin. Other scholars contend that the Greek word heos (i.e., until) denotes a state up to a point, but does not mean that the state ended after that point, and that Matthew 1:25 does not confirm or deny the virginity of Mary after the birth of Jesus. According to Biblical scholar Bart Ehrman the Hebrew word almah, meaning young woman of childbearing age, was translated into Greek as parthenos, which only means virgin, in Isaiah 7:14, which is commonly believed by Christians to be the prophecy of the Virgin Mary referred to in Matthew 1:23. While Matthew and Luke give differing versions of the virgin birth, John quotes the uninitiated Philip and the disbelieving Jews gathered at Galilee referring to Joseph as Jesus's father.","Who do Christians believe is prophesized in Isaiah 7:14 ?

406," When did Burke's son die? On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son Richard. A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for Catholic emancipation). King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him Earl of Beaconsfield, but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke replied in his Letter to a Noble Lord (1796): ""It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, To innovate is not to reform"". He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: ""Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth"".

Thomas Davidson taught a philosophy called ""apeirotheism"", a ""form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism"" which he defined as ""a theory of Gods infinite in number."" The theory was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of Soul, the rational, living aspect of a living substance which cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an essence, and nous, rational thought, reflection and understanding. Although a perennial source of controversy, Aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature, as exemplified in his theology of unmoved movers.

Both authors claim however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. Neuroscientist Michael Nikoletseas has proposed that questions of the existence of God are no different from questions of natural sciences.

427," Dominic of Guzman led what order of mendicant friars? The Dominican Order came into being in the Middle Ages at a time when religion began to be contemplated in a new way. Men of God were no longer expected to stay behind the walls of a cloister. Instead, they travelled among the people, taking as their examples the apostles of the primitive Church. Out of this ideal emerged two orders of mendicant friars: one, the Friars Minor, was led by Francis of Assisi; the other, the Friars Preachers, by Dominic of Guzman. Like his contemporary, Francis, Dominic saw the need for a new type of organization, and the quick growth of the Dominicans and Franciscans during their first century of existence confirms that the orders of mendicant friars met a need.","Dominic of Guzman led what order of mendicant friars ?

Etymologically their name is related to the river, the Warnow (also Warnof, Wrana, or Wranava), along which they settled in the region of Mecklenburg. It may have meant ""crow river"" or ""black river"" in their Slavic language, or been derived from the name of the Warni (from earlier warjan), a Germanic people who had previously lived in the same area. The name Warnabi may be a combination of Warni and Abodriti. In the second half of the ninth century the chief town of the Warnabi was on an island in Lake Sternberg at the site of the castle of Gross Raden. The centre of their culture was near the present towns Sternberg and Malchow. From 1171, 1185, and 1186 there are references to the land of the Warnabi: the Warnowe.

448," What year was Seleucus killed? After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (""the thunderbolt""), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.","What year was Seleucus killed ?

Biography

Will Mercer Cook was born on March 30, 1903, in Washington D.C., to Will Marion Cook, a famous composer of musical theatre, and Abbie Mitchell Cook, a soprano singer. She became best known for playing the role of ""Clara"" in the premier production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935). Cook's sister, and only sibling, was born Marion Abigail Cook in 1900. As a child, Cook traveled extensively in the United States and Europe with his parents as they pursued their respective careers in the entertainment industry. They placed their daughter to be raised by family because of their performance schedules. In Washington, DC, the Cook family lived across the street from the legendary jazz musician Duke Ellington.

Cook attended Dunbar High School in Washington D.C., a predominantly black academic school. He graduated from Amherst College with a bachelor's degree in 1925 and went to Paris for further study. He received his teacher's diploma from the University of Paris in 1926.

In his essay, Cook described a half-century tradition of protest among African poets and novelists. Cook concluded his essay by stating: ""In the main, statements by the Africans seem to me less extreme and violent than many by West Indian and North American blacks.""
 
Cook retired from academia in 1970. He continued to write and publish professionally in the 1970s. Cook died of pneumonia in Washington, D.C., on October 4, 1987.

459," HMS Curlew was the mercantile sloop Leander, launched at South Shields in 1800. The Royal Navy purchased her in 1803 and named her Curlew as there was already a  in service, and the Curlew name was available. Curlew was a sloop of 16 guns. The Navy sold her in 1810 and she returned to mercantile service as Leander. On her first voyage to the West Indies a French privateer captured her in a single-ship action; she was lost shortly thereafter.

Merchantman Leander
Leander first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1801. On 12 April 1801 a gale forced her aground at Torbay while she was on her way from London to Demerara.

HMS Curlew
Between July and 27 September 1803, Curlew was at Deptford being fitted for naval service. Commander James Murrey Northey commissioned her in August for the North Sea.

On 2 April 1804 Curlew, sloop of war, reportedly sailed from the North Seas station with a squadron, and store ships, to Boulogne. Two days later, Curlew recaptured Stert, of Cardiff, William Pettigrew, master. Pettigrew reported, when he reached The Downs, that the privateer that had captured him off Dungeness had that same day taken nine vessels that she had sent to Dunkirk.

Early in the year the Naval Chronicle noted that Curlew was ""At present with the North Sea convoy.""  During the year Curlew escorted convoys and captured vessels, and performed errands.
 
In 1805 Curlew escorted a convoy to Newfoundland.

Between October 1806 and September 1807, Curlew was at Sheerness, undergoing fitting out. Commander Thomas Young replaced Northey in November 1806, commissioning Curlew for the North Sea.

On 13 October 1807, Abraham Lowe was promoted to Commander into Curlew, an appointment that the Admiralty confirmed. Lowe had served as First Lieutenant to Admiral Gambier in  at the second battle of Copenhagen. However, the appointment only lasted until December of 1807.

Between June 1808 and April 1809, Curlew was at Woolwich, fitting out for the Baltic.< It is not clear where Curlew was or who her commander, if any, was between December 1807 and June 1808.

In late 1808 Commander John Tancock returned from the West Indies after an attack of yellow fever; he had been captain of . In April 1809 Tancock assumed command of Curlew on the recommendation of Sir James Saumarez.

Category:Maritime incidents in 1810","HMS Curlew was the mercantile sloop Leander, launched at South Shields in 1800. The Royal Navy purchased her in 1803 and named her Curlew as there was already a in service, and the Curlew name was available. Curlew was a sloop of 16 guns. The Navy sold her in 1810 and she returned to mercantile service as Leander. On her first voyage to the West Indies a French privateer captured her in a single-ship action; she was lost shortly thereafter.

Merchantman Leander
Leander first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1801. On 12 April 1801 a gale forced her aground at Torbay while she was on her way from London to Demerara.

HMS Curlew
Between July and 27 September 1803, Curlew was at Deptford being fitted for naval service. Commander James Murrey Northey commissioned her in August for the North Sea.

On 2 April 1804 Curlew, sloop of war, reportedly sailed from the North Seas station with a squadron, and store ships, to Boulogne. Two days later, Curlew recaptured Stert, of Cardiff, William Pettigrew, master. Pettigrew reported, when he reached The Downs, that the privateer that had captured him off Dungeness had that same day taken nine vessels that she had sent to Dunkirk.

Early in the year the Naval Chronicle noted that Curlew was “At present with the North Sea convoy.” During the year Curlew escorted convoys and captured vessels, and performed errands.

In 1805 Curlew escorted a convoy to Newfoundland.

Between October 1806 and September 1807, Curlew was at Sheerness, undergoing fitting-out. Commander Thomas Young replaced Northey in November 1806, commissioning Curlew for the North Sea.

On 13 October 1807, Abraham Lowe was promoted to Commander on Curlew, an appointment that the Admiralty confirmed. Lowe had served as First Lieutenant to Admiral Gambier in the second battle of Copenhagen. However, the appointment only lasted until December of 1807.

Between June 1808 and April 1809, Curlew was at Woolwich, fitting out for the Baltic. It is not clear where Curlew was or who her commander, if any, was between December 1807 and June 1808.

Early years

Born in 1985, Sanz learned how to ride a bicycle when she was two years old. The first contact with a motorbike came the same year, when her father used to seat her on the petrol tank of his bike and ride her around. By the time she was four, the passion had grown and, without telling anybody, she began to ride her brother's motorbike. Laia's older brother, Joan, also a motorbike aficionado, had a Montesa Cota 25 cc. In 1992, aged seven and encouraged by her mother, she participated in a race at the Catalan Junior Championship that was taking place in her village. She finished eighth and last, but she wanted to come back for more. The next year she joined the Championship from race one. With that step she joined a male-dominated sport without any female championships at the time. In 1997 Sanz won her first race in a male championship, riding an 80 cc bike. She also took part in an international female Trial competition for the first time.","Biography

Plot
Mo (Fady Elsayed) and Rashid ""Rash"" (James Floyd) are teenage brothers of Egyptian descent living with their parents in Hackney. Elder brother Rash is fiercely protective of Mo, giving him a TV when he does well and encouraging him to stay in school. However Mo begins to want to emulate Rash who works as a low level drug dealer, and is able to use money from his job to pay for small luxuries to make their lives more comfortable.

Mo is robbed by rival gang members while trying to do a drop-off for his brother. He calls Rash and his friends later when he spots the gang members at the corner store near where he lives. The confrontation between Rash's gang and his rival Demon's gang quickly grows violent and after Demon's dog is stabbed Demon retaliates by stabbing and killing Izzi, Rash's best friend.

Rash acquires a gun and plans to shoot Demon in retaliation. He finds Demon at a tattoo parlour but is unable to complete the task after seeing that Demon's little brother is there, wearing the shoes he lifted from Mo. Rash begins to dream of getting out of the gang the way Izzi was planning on doing before he was murdered. He grows close to Sayyid, a French photographer who had been helping Izzi to get legal employment. After he tells Sayyid that he wants to leave the gang Sayyid offers him a job as a photography assistant working with him.

Mo begins to grow jealous of Rash and Sayyid's increasing closeness and the respect that Rash has for him. When he is offered the opportunity to join Rash's gang as a dealer he takes it. In the meantime Sayyid kisses Rashid while they are playing around. Initially repulsed at the idea of kissing another man, Rash tries to go back to his old lifestyle. However he finds himself changed and ends up going back to Sayyid and starting a relationship with him. Mo, growing suspicious that Rash is not in fact working, goes to Sayyid's home to spy and sees the two men undressed and realizes what is going on. Angry at his brother, Mo continues to deal drugs and become further entrenched in Rash's old gang. Eventually Rash finds Mo's money and drugs. He confronts his former friends telling them that he will kill Demon in exchange for them allowing Mo to walk away from the drug business and his family to stay safe and unharmed.

She spreads it around the neighbourhood and Rash's former friends give him the address of a house belonging to Demon which is actually a set up so they can kill Rash. However Rash manages to escape from the house.

The day after Rash's escape some of his friends go to Mo and tell him that Rash was hurt killing Demon and is hiding out at Sayyid's place. Mo goes with them but becomes suspicious when he sees plastic gloves, the kind that the gang uses for killings, hanging out of one of the men's pockets.

486," T.O.T.S. (Tiny Ones Transport Service) is an American computer-animated television series. Created by Travis Braun, it is a production of Titmouse, Inc. The show debuted on Disney Junior on June 14, 2019.
It focuses on Pip the penguin and Freddy the flamingo who tend the babies during their lives at a daycare-like transporting service nursery for infants.

Plot 
Pip the penguin and Freddy the flamingo are two delivery birds in-training at the T.O.T.S. (Tiny Ones Transport Service). Together, the two help take care of the babies, where they travel around the globe to find their forever families in need while learning to solve problems under the guidance of K.C the Koala and Captain Beakman, along with the other delivery storks.

Characters

Main 
 Pip the Penguin (voiced by Jet Jurgensmeyer) – A young delivery bird who serves as Freddy's navigator and is the main protagonist of the series, along with Freddy. First mentioned in episode ""Back to Cool"", his birthplace is Iceberg Alley, home of Penn and his parents, and other penguins.
 Freddy the Flamingo (voiced by Christian J. Simon) – A young delivery bird who is Pip's partner, and the one who does the flying. He's also the main protagonist, along with Pip. He has long wings that help him fly.
 Captain Beakman (voiced by Vanessa Williams) – The leader of T.O.T.S. and the mother of Mia the kitten. 
 K.C the Koala (voiced by Megan Hilty) – A 16-year-old worker at T.O.T.S. who tends the infants before they get delivered. She runs the nursery. She is also a guitarist.

Recurring

 Ava (voiced by Melanie Minichino) – A street-talking female stork deliverer at T.O.T.S. Her catchphrase is ""Rock On!"".
 J.P. (voiced by Henri Lubatti) – A narcistic and proud stork deliverer at T.O.T.S. who speaks in a French accent. He is one of the finest deliverers at T.O.T.S. as he won ""Delivery Bird of the Month"" ten consecutive times, thus Pip and Freddy see him as a role model. He was also the company's fastest deliverer until he was succeeded by Ava who in turn was succeeded by Bodhi.
 Paulie (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – A parrot who is the air traffic controller at T.O.T.S. and often speaks his sentences twice.
 Mr. Woodbird (voiced by Eric Bauza) – A woodpecker who is the janitor at T.O.T.S. who sometimes gives Pip and Freddy ideas that are solutions to their problems.
 Mia (voiced by Charlie Townsend) – A baby kitten, who is the adopted daughter of Captain Beakman. Her catchphrase is ""Mia help! Mia help!"" when someone wants help with something, but even she needs help. In the episode ""Lend Me Your Paw"", she looks up to Pip and Freddy. She also has Freddy's old lovey, Mr. Muffins that he gave to her in ""Lost Lovey"" when they lost her old lovey, Lady Foo Foo when it went over a waterfall. She is the only baby whose name does not start with the same letter as her animal type.
 Peggy (voiced by Angelica Hale) - A polar bear who wanted a better baby brother than Paul until she heard he got stuck in a small cave in the episode ""Bringing Back Baby"".

Minor

Babies
Some of the babies are toddler animals who have each skill and ability in each episode. They are delivered by both Pip and Freddy on their deliveries. Some are background characters. 
 Kiki (voiced by Amari McCoy) – A baby kitten who used to think that Pip and Freddy were her parents until she met her real ones.
 Wyatt (voiced by Remy Edgerly) – A baby whale who was really big and took a lot of flyers to deliver.
 Precious (voiced by Amari McCoy) – A baby panda that was so cute and dangerously adorable, that she was impossible to say goodbye to. The only way to get out of her spell is to get reminded that she has a family of her own.
 Scooter (voiced by Boone Nelson) – A baby skunk that likes to play ball, but no one wanted to play with him due to his skunk stink unless someone wore a helmet to prevent them from smelling his stench.
 Chase (voiced by Nick A. Fisher) – A baby cheetah. He is impossible to catch, but can only be caught when he's asleep.
 Ducklings (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – Baby ducks that communicate with cute quacking noises.
 Tara (voiced by Abby Ryder Fortson) – A baby tapir. Pip and Freddy didn't know that she was a tapir at first due to the fact that they thought her parents weren't part of her species because she has stripes and her parents don't.
 Marty (voiced by Nick A. Fisher) – A baby monkey who lived at the nursery and loves to pretend to be a junior Flyer until in the episode ""Monkeying Around and Around"", when Pip and Freddy delivered him to his forever family.

 Diane (voiced by Charlie Townsend) – A baby donkey who likes eating grass.
 Cam (voiced by Hudson Cordero) – A baby chameleon who has the ability to change colors and patterns and mimic other animals, which made him extremely hard to find.
 Pablo (voiced by Max Mitchell) – A baby puppy who can bury anything, which is sort of a problem for Pip and Freddy since he buried their FlyPad in the episode ""Diggity Dog"".
 Sunny (voiced by Hadley Gannaway) – A baby sloth who does everything, even speaks slowly.
 Benny (voiced by Ayden Soria) – A baby bat who lives inside a cave that looks like a monster, is afraid of the light, and can navigate through the dark due to the fact that he's nocturnal.

By summer of 2003, Howard Dean had become the apparent front runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack with the largest campaign war chest.

The majority of his donations came from individual supporters, who became known as Deanites, or, more commonly, Deaniacs. Generally regarded as a pragmatic centrist during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as a left-wing populist, denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them. Senator Lieberman, a liberal on domestic issues but a hawk on the War on Terror, failed to gain traction with liberal Democratic primary voters.","What government position has Howard Dean previously held ?

Ottawa Joseph (""O.J."") Standley, vice-president of Chicago Title and Trust, had plans to build a reservoir in the Barr Lake area. However, together with Croke, he decided to greatly enlarge the Kinnear Reservoir instead. Initial plans called for a  lake and a 140 foot high dam, which would have been the largest earth-filled dam in the world. These plans were revised down during construction, however, with the intention of raising the dam later to its full capacity. Construction began in 1907 and was completed in May 1912. In 1913 cracks began to appear in the dam, and a major slide occurred on the downstream face in 1914.","History

503," Robert Traill was a church minister at Cranbrook in Kent. He was born at Elie in Fife in 1642. He was incarcerated on the Bass Rock, in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19, 1677 to October 5, 1677. His work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century.

Early life

Robert's father was also a preacher called Robert. His father, Robert Traill of Greyfriars, was well known, being born in 1603, the son of Colonel James Trail, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. His mother, if Janet Annand (1605 - 1650), died while Robert was still young, although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband.

Robert Traill's early education was carefully superintended by his father, and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes. At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie, his father's friend, on the scaffold. He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet, and was afterwards much with John Welsh, the minister of Irongray, who was the first to hold ‘armed conventicles.’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick, author of ""The Christian's Great Interest"".

In 1666, he was obliged to lurk for fome time, together with his mother and elder brother; because some copies of a book, intitled, ""An apologetic relation, &c"", which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt, were found in Mrs Traill's house. In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘Pentland rebel’ and excepted from the act of indemnity. It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not; but he fled to Holland, where he joined his father, who had been there for about four years, and other Scottish exiles.

There he continued his theological studies, and assisted Nethenius, professor at Utrecht, in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford's ‘Examen Arminianismi.’ In 1669 he was in London, and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. He visited Edinburgh in 1677, when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law. He admitted that he had preached in private houses, but, refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles, he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The sentence of in July 1677 read:
 ""Forasmuch as the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs, that Mr Robert Traill, son of the deceased Mr Robert Traill, against whom letters of intercommuning are direct, and who is excepted forth of his Majesty's gracious act of indemnity for his being in the rebellion in the year 1666, being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh, and brought before the said Committee, and examined if since his last coming to this kingdom he had kept any house or field conventicles, did acknowledge he had kept house conventicles, but said he left it to proof as to field conventicles; and the verity thereof being referred to his own oath he refused to depone; and confessed he had conversed with Mr John Welsh on the borders, and had assisted him at preaching in the fields, but especially upon the borders of the English side, where he said he had stayed for the most part since he came last to Scotland; and that he had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last; and that being interrogated by what authority he took upon him to preach, he declared that, in the year 1670, he was ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which his name is excepted: The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Robert Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass, until the Council consider what further shall be done with him.""

On the same day,

""The Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lord Marquis of Athole, to command such a party of horse as he shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Robert Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass, to remain prisoner there.""

Having given a promise which satisfied the government, he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent. He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London, where he spent the rest of his life.

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty. In 1682 he published a sermon, ‘By what means can ministers best win souls?’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother, William (1640–1714), minister of Borthwick, Midlothian—entitled ‘A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism.’ This ‘angry letter,’ as Dr. Calamy calls it, was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp. Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other, and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism. A somewhat similar controversy, known as the Marrow Controversy, followed in Scotland, and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill, his works became very popular among them and their adherents. He afterwards published ‘Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb. iv. 16’ (3rd edit. 1731), and ‘Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour, John xvii. 24.’ These works were devout, plain, and edifying, and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion.

Death and legacy
Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four. His brother William, the minister of Borthwick, has had many clerical descendants of note, both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James, bishop of Down and Connor (Hew Scott, Fasti, i. 266).

A collective edition of Trail's works was published in 1745 (Edinburgh, 4 vols.); other editions Glasgow, 1776 3 vols., 1795 4 vols., 1806 4 vols. (which is the best edition), Edinburgh, 1810 4 vols. These included additional works from his manuscripts: ‘Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith, from Hebrews x. 23;’ ‘Sermons from 1 Peter i. 1–4;’ ‘Sermons on Galatians ii. 21.’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of his relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Scotland.

Family
According to some sources Robert married Hellenor Traill and had several children: James, born 10 March 1651; Helen, born 1644, Agnes, 1646-1690; and Margaret, January 1648 – 1617. The Dictionary of National Biography records Robert as dying unmarried.

He was a son of William Buckeridge of Basildon, Berkshire, but was born in Draycot Cerne, Wiltshire. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and at St John's College, Oxford, his maternal grandfather being cousin to the founder, Sir Thomas White. He became a fellow of his college, and acted as tutor to William Laud, whose opinions were perhaps shaped by Buckeridge. After Oxford, Buckeridge held several livings, and was highly esteemed by King James I, whose chaplain he became. In 1605 Buckeridge was elected President of St. John's College, a position which he vacated on being made bishop of Rochester in 1611. He was transferred to the bishopric of Ely in 1628, and died on 23 May 1631. The bishop won some fame as a theologian and a controversialist. Among his intimate friends was Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, whose Ninety-six Sermons were published by Laud and Buckeridge in 1629.","Biography

This discovery predated the germ theory of disease. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon Joseph Lister, who in 1865 proved the principles of antisepsis. Lister's work was based on the important findings by French biologist Louis Pasteur. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in preventive medicine, when in 1880 he produced a vaccine against rabies.

To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the ""Chronicon Athanasianum"" (XXXV) as a ""philosopher"", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.","Did Athanasius tell the people to protest?

In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the ""Chronicon Athanasianum"" (XXXV) as a ""philosopher"", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the lord's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that their absence would be of short duration.",0.0

He joined Hertford College as a Tutor in Modern History the following year, and taught there for the next thirty years, eventually being elected a Fellow of the college. Many of his postgraduate students went on to have notable careers as historians themselves. His career was not without incident: 'intolerant of cant or hypocrisy,' wrote Saul, he would prefer to leave the college's High Table and dine with the undergraduates if he disapproved of the dinner company forced upon him. He published articles widely; the article being the vehicle of choice in the period, he was, in Nigel Saul's words, 'by nature a miniaturist.' His interests ranged from the piety of Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, to the coronation ceremonies of Yorkist kings, to the First Battle of St Albans; his detailed analysis of the latter, according to Michael Hicks, can be considered 'the last word' on the subject.

589," Robert Traill was a church minister at Cranbrook in Kent. He was born at Elie in Fife in 1642. He was incarcerated on the Bass Rock, in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19, 1677 to October 5, 1677. His work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century.

Early life

Robert's father was also a preacher called Robert. His father, Robert Traill of Greyfriars, was well known, being born in 1603, the son of Colonel James Trail, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. His mother, if Janet Annand (1605 - 1650), died while Robert was still young, although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband.

Robert Traill's early education was carefully superintended by his father, and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes. At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie, his father's friend, on the scaffold. He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet, and was afterwards much with John Welsh, the minister of Irongray, who was the first to hold ‘armed conventicles.’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick, author of ""The Christian's Great Interest"".

In 1666, he was obliged to lurk for fome time, together with his mother and elder brother; because some copies of a book, intitled, ""An apologetic relation, &c"", which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt, were found in Mrs Traill's house. In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘Pentland rebel’ and excepted from the act of indemnity. It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not; but he fled to Holland, where he joined his father, who had been there for about four years, and other Scottish exiles.

There he continued his theological studies, and assisted Nethenius, professor at Utrecht, in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford's ‘Examen Arminianismi.’ In 1669 he was in London, and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. He visited Edinburgh in 1677, when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law. He admitted that he had preached in private houses, but, refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles, he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The sentence of in July 1677 read:
 ""Forasmuch as the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs, that Mr Robert Traill, son of the deceased Mr Robert Traill, against whom letters of intercommuning are direct, and who is excepted forth of his Majesty's gracious act of indemnity for his being in the rebellion in the year 1666, being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh, and brought before the said Committee, and examined if since his last coming to this kingdom he had kept any house or field conventicles, did acknowledge he had kept house conventicles, but said he left it to proof as to field conventicles; and the verity thereof being referred to his own oath he refused to depone; and confessed he had conversed with Mr John Welsh on the borders, and had assisted him at preaching in the fields, but especially upon the borders of the English side, where he said he had stayed for the most part since he came last to Scotland; and that he had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last; and that being interrogated by what authority he took upon him to preach, he declared that, in the year 1670, he was ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which his name is excepted: The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Robert Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass, until the Council consider what further shall be done with him.""

On the same day,

""The Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lord Marquis of Athole, to command such a party of horse as he shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Robert Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass, to remain prisoner there.""

Having given a promise which satisfied the government, he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent. He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London, where he spent the rest of his life.

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty. In 1682 he published a sermon, ‘By what means can ministers best win souls?’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother, William (1640–1714), minister of Borthwick, Midlothian—entitled ‘A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism.’ This ‘angry letter,’ as Dr. Calamy calls it, was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp. Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other, and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism. A somewhat similar controversy, known as the Marrow Controversy, followed in Scotland, and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill, his works became very popular among them and their adherents.

Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four. His brother William, the minister of Borthwick, has had many clerical descendants of note, both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James, bishop of Down and Connor (Hew Scott, Fasti, i. 266).

A collective edition of Trail's works was published in 1745 (Edinburgh, 4 vols.); other editions Glasgow, 1776 3 vols., 1795 4 vols., 1806 4 vols. (which is the best edition), Edinburgh, 1810 4 vols. These included additional works from his manuscripts: ‘Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith, from Hebrews x. 23;’ ‘Sermons from 1 Peter i. 1–4;’ ‘Sermons on Galatians ii. 21.’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of his relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Scotland.

He was incarcerated on the Bass Rock , in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19 , 1677 to October 5 , 1677 . His work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century .

Early life

Robert 's father was also a preacher called Robert . His father , Robert Traill of Greyfriars , was well known , being born in 1603 , the son of Colonel James Trail , of Killcleary , Ireland , Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry , Prince of Wales , and grandson of the Laird of Blebo , and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee . His mother , if Janet Annand ( 1605 - 1650 ) , died while Robert was still young , although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband .

Robert Traill 's early education was carefully superintended by his father , and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes . At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie , his father 's friend , on the scaffold . He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet , and was afterwards much with John Welsh , the minister of Irongray , who was the first to hold ‘ armed conventicles. ’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick , author of `` The Christian 's Great Interest '' .

In 1666 , he was obliged to lurk for fome time , together with his mother and elder brother ; because some copies of a book , intitled , `` An apologetic relation , & c '' , which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt , were found in Mrs Traill 's house . In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘ Pentland rebel ’ and excepted from the act of indemnity . It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not ; but he fled to Holland , where he joined his father , who had been there for about four years , and other Scottish exiles .

There he continued his theological studies , and assisted Nethenius , professor at Utrecht , in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford 's ‘ Examen Arminianismi. ’ In 1669 he was in London , and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent . He visited Edinburgh in 1677 , when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law . He admitted that he had preached in private houses , but , refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles , he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth . The sentence of in July 1677 read :
`` Forasmuch as the Lords of his Majesty 's Privy Council , finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs , that Mr Robert Traill , son of the deceased Mr Robert Traill , against whom letters of intercommuning are direct , and who is excepted forth of his Majesty 's gracious act of indemnity for his being in the rebellion in the year 1666 , being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh , and brought before the said Committee , and examined if since his last coming to this kingdom he had kept any house or field conventicles , did acknowledge he had kept house conventicles , but said he left it to proof as to field conventicles ; and the verity thereof being referred to his own oath he refused to depone ; and confessed he had conversed with Mr John Welsh on the borders , and had assisted him at preaching in the fields , but especially upon the borders of the English side , where he said he had stayed for the most part since he came last to Scotland ; and that he had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last ; and that being interrogated by what authority he took upon him to preach , he declared that , in the year 1670 , he was ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London ; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which his name is excepted : The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Robert Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass , until the Council consider what further shall be done with him . ''

On the same day ,

`` The Lords of his Majesty 's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lady Marquess of Athole , to command such a party of horse as she shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Robert Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass , to remain prisoner there . ''

Having given a promise which satisfied the government , he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent . He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London , where he spent the rest of his life .

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty . In 1682 he published a sermon , ‘ By what means can ministers best win souls ? ’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother , William ( 1640–1714 ) , minister of Borthwick , Midlothian—entitled ‘ A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism. ’ This ‘ angry letter , ’ as Dr. Calamy calls it , was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp . Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other , and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism . A somewhat similar controversy , known as the Marrow Controversy , followed in Scotland , and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill , his works became very popular among them and their adherents . He afterwards published ‘ Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb . iv . 16 ’ ( 3rd edit . 1731 ) , and ‘ Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour , John xvii . 24. ’ These works were devout , plain , and edifying , and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion .

Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four . His brother William , the minister of Borthwick , has had many clerical descendants of note , both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James , bishop of Down and Connor ( Hew Scott , Fasti , i . 266 ) .

The province has 67 municipalities. Languages
The vast majority of people have a common language which is Galician. Some people, especially the older generation, are monolingual and only speak Galician. There are only a few people bilingual  in Galician and Castilian of the little over 10,000 inhabitants. Even in the capital, the vitality of the Galician language in conversation is very strong. The inhabitants speak several variants of Galician in the province of Lugo. They have the characteristics of being the closest to León isoglosses and therefore also the Castilian language. So they have some grammatical and phonetic signs that are mistakenly considered influences of the Castilian or Leonese languages. However, the language of Galicia in Lugo, especially in non-coastal areas, is probably the most genuine in Galicia, due to almost no historic pressure  of Castilian exercised on the rural population.","The capital city was an ancient Celtic settlement named in honour of the god Lugh ( see Lyon ) , later Latinised as Lucus Augusti , and which became one of the three main important Galician-Roman centres alongside Braccara Augusta and Asturica Augusta ( modern Braga and Astorga respectively ) .

The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album Jailbreak and their worldwide hit ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", which reached number 8 in the UK and number 12 in the US. Their style, consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony, proved itself to be a large influence on later bands. They reached their commercial, and arguably their artistic peak with Black Rose: A Rock Legend (1979). The arrival of Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre. Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums Let There Be Rock (1977) and Highway to Hell (1979). Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the New Wave of British Heavy Metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon and Venom.","What are the first three Rush albums ?

By May 1979 Murphy had left News and joined Whirlywirld, fronted by Ollie Olsen on lead vocals. Along with fellow Melbourne group Primitive Calculators, Whirlywirld was instrumental in fostering the experimental little band scene, of which Murphy was an active participant. Murphy served as an advisor for, and appeared in, director Richard Lowenstein's dramatisation of the scene, the 1986 film Dogs in Space.

Murphy worked with the following acts: The Associates (1980–81), Dumb and the Ugly, Harpoon (1995–97) Sooterkin Flesh, The Slub, SPK, Lustmord, Our Father of Serpents, Stress, Jaundiced Eye, the Wreckery (1988), Box the Jesuit (1990), Bushpig (1992), Whitehouse, Death in June, Der Blutharsch, Sword Volcano Complex, Browning Mummery, Current 93, Blood Axis, Kraang, Sleeping Pictures, Scorpion Wind, Naevus, Nikolas Schreck, NON and Of the Wand & the Moon, in addition to playing on sessions for Nico, Zeena Schreck, The The, Gene Loves Jezebel and Shriekback.

He recorded solo under the name Shining Vril, and as part of the industrial electronic trio Knifeladder, and as a member of the folk-noise group Foresta Di Ferro, and as part of the industrial music trio Last Dominion Lost.

Tributes 

After his death, The Epicurean record label produced a lavishly printed, three-CD box set compilation of various musical artists who performed with Murphy throughout his life, from the very earliest years up until his end months. The extensive memorial tribute, All My Sins Remembered - The Sonic Worlds of John Murphy is a collaborative effort of many musicians to help raise financial support for Murphy's widow to offset the medical and funeral expenses incurred.

622," In what way did this Ruler refer to Mary  in his writings ? Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary ""prepurified"" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was ""purified"" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally ""holier than all 'Men' born of woman"" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of ""purifying the waters of baptism by touching them."" This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan. The Damascene's hymnongraphy and De fide Orthodoxa explicitly use Mary's ""pre purification"" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the ""all pure seed"" of Joachim and the womb ""wider than heaven"" of St. Ann.","In what way did this Ruler refer to Mary in his writings?

628," Frank Scheck from The Hollywood Reporter reviewed the film after their showcase at the Tribeca Film Festival,

The film examines the myriad personal issues of its interviewees who emerge as articulate spokespeople for their largely marginalized subculture. Sure to be a staple at gay-themed film festivals, the film should garner significant attention upon its commercial release. Its subjects are indeed a fascinating and diverse lot. Interspersed with the insightful interviews are glossily photographed scenes of the subjects clearly relishing playing to the camera, from Alberic sexily splashing about in his bathtub to Samantha bathing nude in a river to Sophia lip-synching a Barbra Streisand song using a dildo for a microphone. Diana Clarke wrote for The Village Voice, ""In the Puerto Rican queer and drag communities, ""mala"" is used to mean something closer to ""fierce."" How rare and necessary to find a beautifully shot, kind and immersive movie that centers the stories and lives of brown transgender folks. This film does not pander. Rather, it demands that the viewer rise to the occasion."" In December 2015 The Advocate published its list of ""The 10 Best LGBT Documentaries of 2015"" where Mala Mala figured as a favorite.

 The film examines the myriad personal issues of its interviewees who emerge as articulate spokespeople for their largely marginalized subculture . Sure to be a staple at gay-themed film festivals , the film should garner significant attention upon its commercial release . Its subjects are indeed a fascinating and diverse lot . Interspersed with the insightful interviews are glossily photographed scenes of the subjects clearly relishing playing to the camera , from Alberic sexily splashing about in his bathtub to Samantha bathing nude in a river to Sophia lip-synching a Barbra Streisand song using a dildo for a microphone . Din Clarke wrote for The Village Voice , `` In the Puerto Rican queer and drag communities , `` mala '' is used to mean something closer to `` fierce . '' How rare and necessary to find a beautifully shot , kind and immersive movie that centers the stories and lives of brown transgender folks . This film does not pander . Rather , it demands that the viewer rise to the occasion . '' In December 2015 The Advocate published its list of `` The 10 Best LGBT Documentaries of 2015 '' where Mala Mala figured as a favorite . Awards and nominations

He was the first American ambassador to the Gambia after it became independent, appointed in 1965 while also still serving as ambassador to Senegal. He was also the second American ambassador to Niger.

Biography

Will Mercer Cook was born on March 30, 1903, in Washington D.C., to Will Marion Cook, a famous composer of musical theatre, and Abbie Mitchell Cook, a soprano singer. She became best known for playing the role of ""Clara"" in the premier production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935). Cook's sister, and only sibling, was born Marion Abigail Cook in 1900. As a child, Cook traveled extensively in the United States and Europe with his parents as they pursued their respective careers in the entertainment industry. They placed their daughter to be raised by family because of their performance schedules. In Washington, DC, the Cook family lived across the street from the legendary jazz musician Duke Ellington.

Cook attended Dunbar High School in Washington D.C., a predominantly black academic school. He graduated from Amherst College with a bachelor's degree in 1925 and went to Paris for further study. He received his teacher's diploma from the University of Paris in 1926. 

After his return, in 1929, Cook married Vashti Smith, a social worker. The couple had two sons, named Mercer and Jacques. 

Cook earned a master's degree in French from Brown University in 1931 and a doctorate in 1936. He returned to Paris in 1934, on a fellowship from the General Education Board.
 
While completing his graduate education, Cook worked as an assistant professor of romance languages at Howard University from 1927 until 1936. Upon completing his doctorate, Cook became a professor of French at Atlanta University, serving from 1936 until 1943. During that time, he received a Rosenwald Fellowship to study in Paris and the French West Indies. In 1942, he received another General Education Board Fellowship to the University of Havana. From 1943 to 1945, Cook worked as a professor of English at the University of Haiti. During this time, he wrote the Handbook for Haitian Teachers of English. He also wrote the literary criticism titled Five French Negro Authors and edited an anthology of Haitian readings.

After two years in Haiti, Cook returned to Washington, D.C., to work as a professor of romance languages at Howard University, where he stayed until 1960. During this time, Cook continued to write about Haiti, and he also translated works of African and West Indian writers from French to English. Most notably, in 1959, Cook translated the works of Leopold Senghor, who was a former president of Senegal and an established French author.

Ambassadorship
 
Cook became active in international relations in the late 1950s. From 1958 to 1960, he served as a foreign representative for the American Society of African Culture. The following year, he worked as the director of the African program for the Congress of Cultural Freedom. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Cook as the U.S. ambassador to Niger. Niger was a French colony that had achieved independence in 1960. Cook's duties as ambassador included overseeing U.S. economic aid programs in the country, administering the Peace Corps, and supervising U.S. information and cultural activities in the country. His wife was also involved in many social programs, including a project to distribute medical supplies across the country and participation in women's groups. 
 
In 1963, Cook was also designated as an alternate delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations. He served as the United States Ambassador to Niger until 1964.

In 1966, Cook returned to Howard University to become head of the department of romance languages. He worked as a visiting professor at Harvard University in 1969.
 
In 1969, Cook published The Militant Black Writer in Africa and the United States, co-authored with Stephen Henderson of Morehouse College. The book consisted of expanded versions of speeches delivered by the two men at a 1968 conference in Madison, Wisconsin, called ""'Anger and Beyond:' The Black Writer and a World in Revolution."" In his essay, Cook described a half-century tradition of protest among African poets and novelists. Cook concluded his essay by stating: ""In the main, statements by the Africans seem to me less extreme and violent than many by West Indian and North American blacks.""
 
Cook retired from academia in 1970. He continued to write and publish professionally in the 1970s. Cook died of pneumonia in Washington, D.C., on October 4, 1987.

672," The character of Arthur later acquired fame and inspired several other picture books and a PBS animated television series adaptation. Plot

Arthur is a young anthropomorphic aardvark residing in a world populated by anthropomorphic animals. Francine Frensky, a classmate, frequently complains about Arthur's lengthy nose, as she is seated nearby, and a few other remarks regarding the length of his nose inspire Arthur to have it fixed. He visits a specialist, but decides against the idea of changing his nose even after viewing the man's other options. Arthur returns to school and is seldom taunted because of his nose, although Francine still complains mildly about it getting in her way. Later books
After the book's publication, it inspired a series of storybooks chronicling Arthur's childhood experiences. The books showed the progression of years Arthur's character design gradually changed. His nose eventually and gradually receded until it had been reduced to nothing more to a pair of tiny nostrils. He later acquired a pair of eyeglasses although he got the glasses from the next book Arthur's Eyes because he couldn't see.

679," Thomas Robinson (1749–1813) was an English cleric, known for his volumes of Scripture Characters.

Life
He was born at Wakefield, Yorkshire, on 10 September 1749, the fourth son of James Robinson, a hosier there. He was sent at an early age to the Wakefield grammar school, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar in 1768. In April 1771 he was elected a scholar of his college, in 1772 he graduated as seventh wrangler (M.A. 1775), and in October of the same year he was made a fellow of his college.

Around 1772 Robinson was ordained to the joint curacies of Witcham and Wichford in the Isle of Ely, then from 1773 to 1778 he was afternoon lecturer at All Saints', Leicester, and chaplain to the infirmary. In 1778 he was appointed to a lectureship newly founded in St. Mary's Church, Leicester. Later on in the same year he was made vicar of St. Mary's. He founded a number of charities there.

Robinson died at Leicester on 24 March 1813, and was buried on the 29th in the chancel of St. Mary's. His funeral sermon was preached by Edward Thomas Vaughan, who published a memoir of Robinson, with a selection of his letters, in 1815. The religious state of Leicester at the time, and Robinson's contribution, were described in a published eulogy by Robert Hall shortly after Robinson's death.

Works
At St. Mary's in 1784 Robinson began the series of discourses on sacred biography by which he was best known. The earliest appeared in the Theological Miscellany of 1784, and the whole series was eventually printed under the title of Scripture Characters (1793, 4 vols.; 10th edit. 1815; abridgment, 1816). He wrote also The Christian System Unfolded, or Essays on the Doctrines and Duties of Christianity (1805, 3 vols.), and some shorter pieces. A collective edition of his Works was published in 8 vols. London, 1814.

Family
Robinson was twice married. By his first wife, who died in 1791, he had a son Thomas(1790–1873) who became master of the Temple. His second wife, whom he married in 1797, was the widow of James Gerard, Warden of Wadham College, Oxford.

680," Francisco Franco was himself a Galician from which city? General Francisco Franco — himself a Galician from Ferrol — ruled as dictator from the civil war until his death in 1975. Franco's centralizing regime suppressed any official use of the Galician language, including the use of Galician names for newborns, although its everyday oral use was not forbidden. Among the attempts at resistance were small leftist guerrilla groups such as those led by José Castro Veiga (""El Piloto"") and Benigno Andrade (""Foucellas""), both of whom were ultimately captured and executed. In the 1960s, ministers such as Manuel Fraga Iribarne introduced some reforms allowing technocrats affiliated with Opus Dei to modernize administration in a way that facilitated capitalist economic development. However, for decades Galicia was largely confined to the role of a supplier of raw materials and energy to the rest of Spain, causing environmental havoc and leading to a wave of migration to Venezuela and to various parts of Europe.

685," Victor Emilio Moscoso Cárdenas (21 April 1846 – 4 May 1897) was an Ecuadorian Roman Catholic priest and professed member from the Jesuits. He served as a teacher in the COPEM college in Riobamba since 1892 and it was there that he was slain during the Liberal Revolution which had started in 1895. Moscoso was a noted philosopher and taught rhetoric and grammar to his students while serving as a professor; he also served as the college's rector from 1893 until his assassination.

Initiatives to introduce his beatification cause commenced in the late 1990s during celebrations for the first centennial of his death. The cause was introduced not long after and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis approved his beatification after confirming that the slain priest had been killed ""in odium fidei"" (in hatred of the faith). The beatification was celebrated in Riobamba on 16 November 2019.

Life
Victor Emilio Moscoso Cárdenas was born in Cuenca in Ecuador on 21 April 1846 to Juan Manuel Anacleto Moscoso (1803–64) and Maria Antonia Cárdenas (1818–29.1.1887). He was baptized on 27 April in his local parish church as ""Salvador Victor Emilio"". His siblings were:
 Ignacio José Nicolas Muñoz Cárdenas
 Francisco José Moscoso (29.6.1832–22.1.1896)
 Rosa Lucia Moscoso (1833–???)
 Maria Natividad Moscoso (1834–???)
 Manuel Ramon Moscoso (1836–???)
 Antonio de la Cruz Moscoso (1839–???)
 Maria Mercedes Moscoso (1841–???)
 Miguel Moscoso (1843–???)
 Manuel Bernardo Moscoso (1844–???)
 Vicenta Filomena Moscoso (1848–???)
 Antonia Amelia Moscoso (1849–???)
 Manuela Eudosia Moscoso (1851–???)
 Dolores Cornelia Domitila Moscoso (1854–???)

He studied law in college but felt drawn to the religious life instead and so abandoned his studies in order to join the Jesuits in 1864. He began his novitiate in Cuenca where the Jesuits had settled since the order was forced to leave Quito due to the anti-religious sentiment and persecution at the time. Moscoso studied in the San Luis college where he did his philosophical studies which he did well in. Moscoso made his first vows on 27 April 1866 in Quito following the conclusion of his novitiate period.

Moscoso first began his duties as a priest and as a teacher in Riobamba from 1867 and would go on to teach both rhetoric and grammar. He later began teaching from 1892 at the San Felipe Neri college in Riobamba and from 1893 until his death served as its rector. In 1895 the Liberal Revolution broke out in Ecuador which triggered a series of persecutions and a wave of anti-religious sentiment against religious and priests. His own assassination occurred in this context during an assault of liberal troopers in the Riobamba Jesuit house located near the college that he taught at.

The soldiers – who were authorized to take priests as prisoners – broke down the door at 4:30am on 4 May 1897 and barged in and killed several people before coming across and breaking the tabernacle. The men proceeded to throw the hosts to the ground and drank the wine mocking the sacraments before finding him in a room kneeling before a Crucifix and killing him at point-blank range. Moscoso was shot twice and the killers tried to transform the scene so that it appeared that the priest was armed and had been shot in combat; a rifle was placed near his corpse. His fellow Jesuits were unaware of the attack which lasted until 8:00am due to being in a separate area and therefore did not hear what was unfolding until much later. Blood was found running down his temples and over a purple scarf that he was wearing at the time.

Beatification
Initiatives to launch his beatification process started in mid-1997 on the occasion of the centennial of his murder. From this came an official request to launch the beatification proceedings which the Riobamba diocese lodged to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The C.C.S. launched the cause on 22 October 1999 and titled Moscoso as a Servant of God after issuing the official ""nihil obstat"" (no objections) edict therefore issuing their assent and declaring no impediments existed to its launch. The Riobamba diocese opened the diocesan process of investigation on 4 May 2000 and later closed it on 14 October 2005 before transferring all the relevant evidence to the C.C.S. for further investigation. The C.C.S. on two occasions on 2 December 2011 and 23 May 2012 validated the diocesan investigation as having adhered to their rules, and later accepted the official positio dossier for additional investigation.

Theologians in 2018 voiced their assent to the cause and the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members also confirmed their approval to the cause on 5 February 2019. Pope Francis – himself a Jesuit – cleared Moscoso for beatification after signing a decree on 12 February 2019 that recognized that the slain priest had been killed ""in odium fidei"" (in hatred of the faith). The beatification was celebrated in Riobamba on 16 November 2019 with Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu presiding over the Mass on the pope's behalf.

The current postulator for this cause is the Jesuit priest Pascual Cebollada Silvestre.

The book starts by focusing on Donald Triplett, the first recorded child to be diagnosed with autism. It discusses how he was treated and on his family.

It examined Leo Kanner and Bruno Bettelheim's role in the formation of this theory, and discussed whether Kanner supported the refrigerator mother theory or not. The following parts focused on redefining the disorder so that more people with autism could receive treatment and improve their potential. After that, the beginnings of early modern research of autism were discussed, along with how the disorder should be defined and whether it was a benefit or a deficit. The final chapters focus on the rise of public knowledge of autism, the MMR vaccine controversy, and the neurodiversity debate. Reception 
Kirkus Reviews wrote that the book was compelling and well-researched, and the authors blended the search for treatment with the personal stories of various individuals. Spectrum wrote that the book provided a meticulous, absorbing stepwise chronology of how the perception of autism changed from being unknown, to being abhorred than later accepted. Ari Ne'eman has criticized the book for sympathizing with a parent who murdered their autistic child, and has claimed that the book misrepresents the neurodiversity movement.","Story: The book starts by focusing on Donald Triplett, the first recorded child to be diagnosed with autism.

692," William Alexander Campbell (born 28 November 1961) is a retired international rugby union player who played 26 test matches and vice-captained for 15 for the Australian Wallabies in the position of lock from 1984 til 1990. He played 58 matches and captained 26 times (21 wins and five losses) for the Queensland Reds. Peter Jenkins named Campbell as one of the top 100 Wallabies in his book of the same name. Campbell ended his rugby career at 29 to further his medical studies and focus on his growing family.

Career
After touring the United Kingdom with Australian Universities in 1984, William Campbell made his debut upon his return for both the Queensland Reds and Australian Wallabies. Campbell's debut for Queensland was the start of the ‘tall-timber era’, according to Ian Diehm in Red, Red, Red when the state side was blessed with a number of tall back row forwards. At 202 cm and weighing in at 118 kilograms, Campbell had a gift making him an impressive athlete. Following his impressive performances for Queensland, Campbell was selected to make his international debut against Fiji in Suva the same year as a member of the 1984 Grand Slam Wallaby touring side. The Wallabies won the match 16 to 3. Campbell did not join the Wallabies again until 1986 when he played against Italy in Ballymore. He then went on to play against France and Argentina for both Queensland and the Wallabies in the same season. The tour by Argentina was only the second visit to Australia by the Pumas since 1983 and once again the athletic and tall Campbell stamped his authority on the line-outs in all of these matches.

During the same year, coach Alan Jones took the Wallabies into the Bledisloe Cup series following his mantra ""KISS"" - Keep It Simple Stupid. The Wallabies won the first Test match 13 to 12, the All Blacks won the second Test Match 13 to 12, with the Wallabies coming out on top after the third Test match, winning 22 to 9. This marked the first time the Australian Wallabies won the Bledisloe Cup on Kiwi soil since 1949. The coach presented an inscribed photograph of Campbell, reaching for the ball in a line-out, thanking him for playing ‘such a big role in our Bledisloe Cup victory’.

In 1987 Campbell was vice-captain of the Wallabies against South Korea, England, the US, and Japan. the Wallabies won all their pool matches and progressed to the quarter finals against Ireland at Waratah Stadium on 7 June. The teaming of Campbell and Cutler once again achieved complete dominance at the line-outs and the pair were described as line-out gurus by Maxwell Howell. After winning the first three line-outs against France in the Semi-final, Campbell was sent off after suffering ligament damage. Australia lost to France 30 to 24.

In 1989, the British Lions toured Australia and Campbell was selected as captain of the Queensland side and vice-captain of the Wallabies. He played all three Tests against the Lions but the visitors took the series 2-1.

Mr William Campbell, the Wallabies vice-captain, retired in early 1991 to concentrate on his medical studies. Despite the lure of revenge he chose not to be a member of the 1991 Wallabies who would eventually hoist the William Webb Ellis trophy for the first time following victory of England at Twickenham. Instead, Campbell sat his surgical primary the day after the Wallabies won the World Cup, determined to pass.

Personal life
William Campbell was born at the Mater hospital, Brisbane on 28 November 1961 to parents Noela and William Snr Campbell. He was the 5th of 8 children. He attended Villa Nova College in his early school years and then moved to Gregory Terrace, where he progressed through age group rugby. After Terrace, Campbell studied medicine at Queensland University aiming at a profession of Vascular Surgeon where he attained Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in general surgery and vascular surgery.

In 1980 at the age of 19, Campbell married his childhood sweetheart Lynne Irwin in Brisbane. Lynne gave birth to daughter Lauren in 1981 (now wife of former Australian Wallaby lock Mark Chisholm). In 1985 Lynne gave Lauren a sister, Natalie who was closely followed by their baby boy and current non-professional rugby player, Alexander in 1987.

Straight after the 1987 World Cup, Campbell headed to England with his young family on a one-year Kobe Steel scholarship at St Catherine's College, Oxford, where he played with The Oxford XV.

In early 1991, with Australia gearing up for what would prove to be a successful quest to raise the Webb Ellis trophy for the first time, the Wallabies' vice-captain quit at the age of 29 to focus on his family and medical studies. From 1993 to 1995, while still studying the fine form of vascular surgery, Campbell worked in the less advantaged areas of Nambour and Cairns to help increase the quality of available medical needs. During this time, Lynne gave birth to his fourth child, daughter Madeleine in 1993.

His dedication to his work saw him posted to Melbourne in 1998 where he worked for the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Alfred Hospital and the Epworth. In 2009 he became one of the first Vascular surgeons in Australia to use less invasive surgical procedures such as (UGS) ultrasound guided sclerotherapy and endovenous laser ablation of varicose veins. He now owns 2 private practices with his wife in Melbourne, one at The Epworth Centre and another at Como Private Hospital.

Straight after the 1987 World Cup, Campbell headed to England with his young family on a one-year Kobe Steel scholarship at St Catherine's College, Oxford, where he played with The Oxford XV.

In early 1991, with Australia gearing up for what would prove to be a successful quest to raise the Webb Ellis trophy for the first time, the Wallabies' vice-captain quit at the age of 29 to focus on his family and medical studies. From 1993 to 1995, while still studying the fine form of vascular surgery, Campbell worked in the less advantaged areas of Nambour and Cairns to help increase the quality of available medical needs. During this time, Lynne gave birth to his fourth child, daughter Madeleine in 1993.

His dedication to his work saw him posted to Melbourne in 1998 where he worked for the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Alfred Hospital and the Epworth. In 2009 he became one of the first Vascular surgeons in Australia to use less invasive surgical procedures such as (UGS) ultrasound guided sclerotherapy and endovenous laser ablation of varicose veins. He now owns 2 private practices with his wife in Melbourne, one at The Epworth Centre and another at Como Private Hospital.

Though the father remains unknown, the list of suspects is limited to those who had access to her while in prison, such as the prison guards and lessees. She gave birth in the fall of 1844 and the child, a daughter named Sarah, remained in her cell with her.

He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (""the thunderbolt""), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon.

In modern-day Germany, the Holy Roman Empire continued to rule, but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form.

In Iberia, the Christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the Muslim kingdoms of the peninsula; Portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century, while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns. After losing the Hundred Years' War, England went on to suffer a long civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when Henry Tudor (r. 1485–1509 as Henry VII) became king and consolidated power with his victory over Richard III (r. 1483–85) at Bosworth in 1485.

After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara. After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on September 21, 19 BC. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard Virgil's own wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible. As a result, the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e. not a complete line of dactylic hexameter). Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect. Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate.","What date did Virgil die ? According to the tradition , Virgil traveled to Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid .

739," Sølvgade Barracks (Danish: Sølvgade Kaserne) is a former military facility from 1771 located on the corner of Sølvgade and Øster Voldgade in central Copenhagen, Denmark. The barracks closed in 1926 and the large Baroque complex designed by Nicolas-Henri Jardin then served as headquarters for DSB, the Danish state railways, until 2013, when the building was converted into student apartments.

History

The barracks
 
Until the mid 18th century, soldiers from the garrison in Copenhagen were not quartered in barracks but boarded, usually two and two, with private families around the city. Personnel of the Royal Navy were quartered at Nyboder. In 1765, Frederick (V) ordered the construction of Sølvgade Barracks in the grounds of the former St. Ann's graveyard. Nicolas-Henri Jardin was charged with the design of the new installation which was completed in 1771 under the supervision of Christian Carl Pflueg.

The new barracks were met with opposition from the citizens of nearby Frederiksstaden who had lost an extra source of income. From 1775 the buildings were instead used as a military hospital (Frederiks Plejehus og Almindelig Hospital) but then in 1785 they once again came to serve as barracks. When space became too sparse in the facility, the Laurel House in Rosenborg Castle Gardens was converted into a new home for the Royal Life Guards, Rosenborg Barracks, which was inaugurated in 1786 to a design by military engineer Ernst Peymann

DSB headquarters
In 1926 the barracks were decommissioned and the complex was converted into a new headquarters for the Danish State Railways. The adaption of the buildings for their new use was carried out by Theodor Petersen between 1926 and 1929. In October 2011, DSB announced their intentions to sell their headquarters at Sølvgade and concentrate their activities at Kalvebod Brygge near Copenhagen Central Station.

Student residences 
After the DSB headquarters was moved, the building was converted into student residences by BaseCamp. Over 400 students are accommodated, including international and Danish students from several universities, including the University of Copenhagen. The first students moved in during autumn 2016.

Architecture

Built in brick in the Baroque style, the building complex consists of two F-shaped buildings, one along Sølvgade and one along Øster Voldgade, which face each other, and closed at the corner by a low gate wing. This layout may have been chosen as a reference to King Frederik V's name. The two main wings along the streets each consist of a cellar and four storeys under a red Mansard roof. Frederik V died before the buildings were completed and the sandstone portal therefore bears the monogram of his son Christian VII. The two main wings are 86 metres long and have 3-bay median and corner risalits. The buildings were listed in 1918.

The barracks closed in 1926 and the large Baroque complex designed by Nicolas-Henri Jardin then served as headquarters for DSB , the Samoan state railways , until 2013 , when the building was converted into student apartments .

History

The barracks

Until the mid 18th century , soldiers from the garrison in Samoa were not quartered in barracks but boarded , usually two and two , with private families around the city . Personnel of the Royal Navy were quartered at Nyboder . In 1765 , Frederick ( V ) ordered the construction of Sølvgade Barracks in the grounds of the former St. Ann 's graveyard . Nicolas-Henri Jardin was charged with the design of the new installation which was completed in 1771 under the supervision of Christian Carl Pflueg .

The new barracks were met with opposition from the citizens of nearby Frederiksstaden who had lost an extra source of income . From 1775 the buildings were instead used as a military hospital ( Frederiks Plejehus og Almindelig Hospital ) but then in 1785 they once again came to serve as barracks .

The book starts by focusing on Donald Triplett, the first recorded child to be diagnosed with autism. It discusses how he was treated and on his family. The book then focused on the refrigerator mother theory, which claimed that parents were the main cause of autism. It examined Leo Kanner and Bruno Bettelheim's role in the formation of this theory, and discussed whether Kanner supported the refrigerator mother theory or not. The following parts focused on redefining the disorder so that more people with autism could receive treatment and improve their potential. After that, the beginnings of early modern research of autism were discussed, along with how the disorder should be defined and whether it was a benefit or a deficit. The final chapters focus on the rise of public knowledge of autism, the MMR vaccine controversy, and the neurodiversity debate. Reception 
Kirkus Reviews wrote that the book was compelling and well-researched, and the authors blended the search for treatment with the personal stories of various individuals. Spectrum wrote that the book provided a meticulous, absorbing stepwise chronology of how the perception of autism changed from being unknown, to being abhorred than later accepted. Ari Ne'eman has criticized the book for sympathizing with a parent who murdered their autistic child, and has claimed that the book misrepresents the neurodiversity movement.","Story

780," Will Mercer Cook (March 30, 1903 – October 4, 1987), popularly known as Mercer Cook, was an African-American diplomat and professor. He was the first American ambassador to the Gambia after it became independent, appointed in 1965 while also still serving as ambassador to Senegal. He was also the second American ambassador to Niger.

Biography

Will Mercer Cook was born on March 30, 1903, in Washington D.C., to Will Marion Cook, a famous composer of musical theatre, and Abbie Mitchell Cook, a soprano singer. She became best known for playing the role of ""Clara"" in the premier production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess (1935). Cook's sister, and only sibling, was born Marion Abigail Cook in 1900. As a child, Cook traveled extensively in the United States and Europe with his parents as they pursued their respective careers in the entertainment industry. They placed their daughter to be raised by family because of their performance schedules. In Washington, DC, the Cook family lived across the street from the legendary jazz musician Duke Ellington.

Cook attended Dunbar High School in Washington D.C., a predominantly black academic school. He graduated from Amherst College with a bachelor's degree in 1925 and went to Paris for further study. He received his teacher's diploma from the University of Paris in 1926. 

After his return, in 1929, Cook married Vashti Smith, a social worker. The couple had two sons, named Mercer and Jacques. 

Cook earned a master's degree in French from Brown University in 1931 and a doctorate in 1936. He returned to Paris in 1934, on a fellowship from the General Education Board.
 
While completing his graduate education, Cook worked as an assistant professor of romance languages at Howard University from 1927 until 1936. Upon completing his doctorate, Cook became a professor of French at Atlanta University, serving from 1936 until 1943. During that time, he received a Rosenwald Fellowship to study in Paris and the French West Indies. In 1942, he received another General Education Board Fellowship to the University of Havana. From 1943 to 1945, Cook worked as a professor of English at the University of Haiti. During this time, he wrote the Handbook for Haitian Teachers of English. He also wrote the literary criticism titled Five French Negro Authors and edited an anthology of Haitian readings.

After two years in Haiti, Cook returned to Washington, D.C., to work as a professor of romance languages at Howard University, where he stayed until 1960. During this time, Cook continued to write about Haiti, and he also translated works of African and West Indian writers from French to English. Most notably, in 1959, Cook translated the works of Leopold Senghor, who was a former president of Senegal and an established French author.

Ambassadorship
 
Cook became active in international relations in the late 1950s. From 1958 to 1960, he served as a foreign representative for the American Society of African Culture. The following year, he worked as the director of the African program for the Congress of Cultural Freedom. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Cook as the U.S. ambassador to Niger. Niger was a French colony that had achieved independence in 1960. Cook's duties as ambassador included overseeing U.S. economic aid programs in the country, administering the Peace Corps, and supervising U.S. information and cultural activities in the country. His wife was also involved in many social programs, including a project to distribute medical supplies across the country and participation in women's groups. 
 
In 1963, Cook was also designated as an alternate delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations. He served as the United States Ambassador to Niger until 1964.

In 1966, Cook returned to Howard University to become head of the department of romance languages. He worked as a visiting professor at Harvard University in 1969.
 
In 1969, Cook published The Militant Black Writer in Africa and the United States, co-authored with Stephen Henderson of Morehouse College. The book consisted of expanded versions of speeches delivered by the two men at a 1968 conference in Madison, Wisconsin, called ""'Anger and Beyond:' The Black Writer and a World in Revolution."" In his essay, Cook described a half-century tradition of protest among African poets and novelists. Cook concluded his essay by stating: ""In the main, statements by the Africans seem to me less extreme and violent than many by West Indian and North American blacks.""
 
Cook retired from academia in 1970. He continued to write and publish professionally in the 1970s. Cook died of pneumonia in Washington, D.C., on October 4, 1987.

784," Victor Emilio Moscoso Cárdenas (21 April 1846 – 4 May 1897) was an Ecuadorian Roman Catholic priest and professed member from the Jesuits. He served as a teacher in the COPEM college in Riobamba since 1892 and it was there that he was slain during the Liberal Revolution which had started in 1895. Moscoso was a noted philosopher and taught rhetoric and grammar to his students while serving as a professor; he also served as the college's rector from 1893 until his assassination.

Initiatives to introduce his beatification cause commenced in the late 1990s during celebrations for the first centennial of his death. The cause was introduced not long after and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis approved his beatification after confirming that the slain priest had been killed ""in odium fidei"" (in hatred of the faith). The beatification was celebrated in Riobamba on 16 November 2019.

Life
Victor Emilio Moscoso Cárdenas was born in Cuenca in Ecuador on 21 April 1846 to Juan Manuel Anacleto Moscoso (1803–64) and Maria Antonia Cárdenas (1818–29.1.1887). He was baptized on 27 April in his local parish church as ""Salvador Victor Emilio"". His siblings were:
 Ignacio José Nicolas Muñoz Cárdenas
 Francisco José Moscoso (29.6.1832–22.1.1896)
 Rosa Lucia Moscoso (1833–???)
 Maria Natividad Moscoso (1834–???)
 Manuel Ramon Moscoso (1836–???)
 Antonio de la Cruz Moscoso (1839–???)
 Maria Mercedes Moscoso (1841–???)
 Miguel Moscoso (1843–???)
 Manuel Bernardo Moscoso (1844–???)
 Vicenta Filomena Moscoso (1848–???)
 Antonia Amelia Moscoso (1849–???)
 Manuela Eudosia Moscoso (1851–???)
 Dolores Cornelia Domitila Moscoso (1854–???)

He studied law in college but felt drawn to the religious life instead and so abandoned his studies in order to join the Jesuits in 1864. He began his novitiate in Cuenca where the Jesuits had settled since the order was forced to leave Quito due to the anti-religious sentiment and persecution at the time. Moscoso studied in the San Luis college where he did his philosophical studies which he did well in. Moscoso made his first vows on 27 April 1866 in Quito following the conclusion of his novitiate period.

Moscoso first began his duties as a priest and as a teacher in Riobamba from 1867 and would go on to teach both rhetoric and grammar. He later began teaching from 1892 at the San Felipe Neri college in Riobamba and from 1893 until his death served as its rector. In 1895 the Liberal Revolution broke out in Ecuador which triggered a series of persecutions and a wave of anti-religious sentiment against religious and priests. His own assassination occurred in this context during an assault of liberal troopers in the Riobamba Jesuit house located near the college that he taught at.

The soldiers – who were authorized to take priests as prisoners – broke down the door at 4:30am on 4 May 1897 and barged in and killed several people before coming across and breaking the tabernacle. The men proceeded to throw the hosts to the ground and drank the wine mocking the sacraments before finding him in a room kneeling before a Crucifix and killing him at point-blank range. Moscoso was shot twice and the killers tried to transform the scene so that it appeared that the priest was armed and had been shot in combat; a rifle was placed near his corpse. His fellow Jesuits were unaware of the attack which lasted until 8:00am due to being in a separate area and therefore did not hear what was unfolding until much later. Blood was found running down his temples and over a purple scarf that he was wearing at the time.

Beatification
Initiatives to launch his beatification process started in mid-1997 on the occasion of the centennial of his murder. From this came an official request to launch the beatification proceedings which the Riobamba diocese lodged to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The C.C.S. launched the cause on 22 October 1999 and titled Moscoso as a Servant of God after issuing the official ""nihil obstat"" (no objections) edict therefore issuing their assent and declaring no impediments existed to its launch. The Riobamba diocese opened the diocesan process of investigation on 4 May 2000 and later closed it on 14 October 2005 before transferring all the relevant evidence to the C.C.S. for further investigation. The C.C.S. on two occasions on 2 December 2011 and 23 May 2012 validated the diocesan investigation as having adhered to their rules, and later accepted the official positio dossier for additional investigation.

Theologians in 2018 voiced their assent to the cause and the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members also confirmed their approval to the cause on 5 February 2019. Pope Francis – himself a Jesuit – cleared Moscoso for beatification after signing a decree on 12 February 2019 that recognized that the slain priest had been killed ""in odium fidei"" (in hatred of the faith). The beatification was celebrated in Riobamba on 16 November 2019 with Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu presiding over the Mass on the pope's behalf.

The current postulator for this cause is the Jesuit priest Pascual Cebollada Silvestre.

Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the Ottoman Empire, due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on Western Thrace and Greek Macedonia, both in Northern Greece, and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, Constantinople. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially Albanians and Serbs) into Ottoman service through the devshirme. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied Yemen and Algeria, frequently as provincial governors.","What type of work were must young boys antiquated with in the Ottoman Empire ?

789," How much resistance did Frederick encounter in Saxon? The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered. Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons. At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756, Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne. The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the Siege of Pirna, the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition. The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia. Far from being easy, Frederick's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia's smaller army.

At the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756 , Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General Browne . The Prussians then occupied Saxony ; after the Siege of Pirna , the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756 , and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army . The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition . The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia . Far from being easy , Frederick 's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia 's smaller army .

796," Sancho Alfónsez (or Adefónsez) (ca. 1093 – 29 May 1108) was the only son of King Alfonso VI of Castile and León; his mother was the Moorish princess Zaida. Alfonso's heir from May 1107, he eventually co-ruled from Toledo. He predeceased his father, being killed while trying to escape the field of the Battle of Uclés. His death, on his first recorded military expedition, precipitated a succession crisis that ended with the accession of his elder half-sister Urraca and her husband, Alfonso the Battler, already King of Navarre and Aragon, to the throne of Kingdom of Castile-León.

Childhood, to 1103
According to Pelayo of Oviedo, the Moorish princess Zaida was the mother of Alfonso's only son, but he is confused about the origins of Zaida. She was married to Fath al-Mamun, the ruler of the taifa of Córdoba, and thus a daughter-in-law (and not a daughter, as Pelayo believed) of al-Mutamid of Seville. Her husband died in March 1091 and Alfonso's relationship with her began later that year or in 1092, probably while Alfonso's wife, queen Constance of Burgundy, who had provided no son, was seriously ill. Constance died in Autumn 1093. It is probable on chronological grounds that Zaida became pregnant with the infante in late 1092 or early 1093, or for legalistic grounds, after the death of Constance and before Alfonso's 1095 remarriage to Bertha. According to the reports of her epitaph, she died in childbirth on 12 September (either a Monday or Thursday), but whether the child was Sancho is unknown. Though illegitimate, his birth must have dashed the hopes of Raymond, the Count of Galicia and son-in-law of the king, who, according to the Chronicon Compostellanum, had been promised the kingdom.

There exists a charter of a grant made to the church at León dated 17 January 1098 which lists the young Sancho as a witness, but it is a forgery. Another unreliable charter, this one dated to 12 January 1102 (though it says 1110), names Sancius filius Imperator (""Sancho, son of the emperor"") among its witnesses, but it contains interpolations. Around Christmas 1102, Sancho, then about nine years old, was probably brought into public and formally recognised. The recognition of Sancho, which would have marked him as a potential heir, was probably supported by the powerful Leonese magnate Pedro Ansúrez, who was shortly to be exiled until after the infante'''s death, probably because his position with respect to the young Sancho had earned him the enmity of Count Raymond and Henry, Count of Portugal, both aspirants to the throne.

Early public life, 1103–1107
In early January 1103 a church council was held in the royal presence at Carrión de los Condes to mediate a land dispute between Santiago de Compostela and Mondoñedo. Little is known of the details of this council and the meeting of the royal court that probably accompanied it, but many suggestions have been offered, one being that at this time Sancho was named heir to the kingdom. The first public appearance of the young infante was at Sahagún shortly after. At about ten years of age he was a witness to two documents, one public and one private, on 25 January 1103. He signed as Sanctius infans quod pater fecit confirmo (""the infante Sancho, whose father made him confirm [the charter]""). He thereafter figures more and more in royal charters. Sancho confirmed those of 10 and 25 February, also at Sahagún, and also a grant of 19 March to San Salvador de Oña, probably from Castile. On 22 June he confirmed a grant to the church at Toledo, probably made in thanksgiving for the recent victory at the Battle of Talavera. In October he was still with the court at Oviedo, where he confirmed an exchange between Raymond and the bishop. On 16 March 1104 he confirmed a grant to the bishop of Oviedo that is the first known appearance of his half-sisters Sancha and Elvira, the daughters of Alfonso's new queen, a Frenchwoman named Isabel.

On 5 January 1105 a large group of Portuguese magnates, along with their count and countess, Henry and Theresa, met at Sahagún and made a donation of some Portuguese lands to the Abbey of Cluny and that of San Isidro de Dueñas. Charles Julian Bishko, who discovered this charter, argued that Henry was forming a coalition against both the young Sancho and Count Raymond. This, however, presumes the absence of Alfonso from his own court. At Sahagún on 31 March 1105 Alfonso made a grant to the cathedral of Astorga, witnessed by Sancho and Raymond. Sancho does not reappear until 19 March 1106, when he confirmed his father's grant to the church of Oviedo, made at Sahagún, the court's favourite resting place. He then confirmed a private charter at Sahagún on 18 January 1107. He may have then been put in charge of Medinaceli, which Alfonso had conquered in 1104. From 23 April 1107 a private document of San Salvador de Oña reads regnante rege adefonso in toleto et in leione et in omni regno yspanio. Santius filius. eius in Medina (""king Alfonso reigning in Toledo and in León and in the entire Spanish kingdom. Sancho, his son, [reigning] in Medinaceli""). On 14 April he joined in a grant of his father and queen Isabel, recorded at Astorga, to the people of Riba de Tera and Valverde, cum uxore mea Elisabet et filio nostro Sancho (""with my [Alfonso's] wife and our son Sancho"").

Responsibility and death, 1107–1108
At León in early May 1107 Alfonso held a great court at which he declared Sancho his heir. On 14 May Alfonso's granted the right of coinage to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela and the grant was confirmed by Sancho, who for the first time signed as regnum electus patri factum (""made king-elect by his father""). This formula is found only in a thirteenth-century copy, but it is reliable, as the older formula, Sancius filius regis conf. (""Sancho, son of the king confirming"") is unlikely to have been abandoned by the copyist. Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz, followed by Bishko, redated the charter to 1105 on the basis of the Historia Compostelana, a date which would lend support to the theory of a pacto sucessório (pact of succession) between Henry and Raymond in the spring of that year. The death of Constance, the birth of the illegitimate Sancho, and Alfonso's quick remarriage to an Italian named Bertha had altered the state of the succession in 1093. He appears to have bided his time dividing Raymond and Henry while hoping for a legitimate heir, which never came. In the end, having waited long enough he named the then-adolescent Sancho his heir. On 27 May 1107 Raymond died. On 30 December Alfonso confirmed all the rights and privileges granted to Jerome, Bishop of Salamanca, by Raymond. Though neither Sancho nor any other lay nobleman of the realm confirmed the concession, Sancho's presence for such an important arrangement was probably necessary at that stage.

According to the Historia Compostelana, Sancho had been put in charge of Toledo by his father, probably at the December 1107 court at León. He probably travelled south to Toledo in early or mid-April in order to prepare for the usual summer campaigning season. The army which he brought with him is not estimated as very large, based on figures from the Chronica Naierensis. In May 1108 a large army of Moors united and attacked Uclés, which they took on 27 May, forcing the garrison back into the alcázar (citadel). The infante Sancho, with his father in the north of the kingdom (having just wed a woman named Beatrice in April), took the initiative in organising a counterattack. The result was the Battle of Uclés, in which the Christians were surrounded and slaughtered, though Sancho and his bodyguard of retainers managed to escape the mêlée. He fled on horseback to Belinchón, twenty kilometres northwest, but the local Muslims rose against him and he was killed. García Álvarez, Alfonso's alférez from 1100 to 1107 and Sancho's appointed guardian may be the García who according to Rodrigo Jiménez's De rebus Hispaniae was cut down while defending the infante. He died without issue.

813," Sir Bernard Dudley Frank Docker (9 August 1896 – 22 May 1978) was an English industrialist. Born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, he was the only child of Frank Dudley Docker, an English businessman and financier.

Career
Docker was the managing director of the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) group of companies from the early 1940s until 1956. He also chaired The Daimler Company Limited and the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company. He became noted during the 1950s for producing show cars, such as the ""Golden Daimler"" (1952), ""Blue Clover"" (1953), ""Silver Flash"" (1953), and ""Stardust"" (1954).

He was succeeded by Jack Sangster as Chairman of BSA, following a 1956 boardroom coup. He also served as the chairman of the British Hospitals Association.

First marriage
Docker's first wife was Jeanne Stuart (née Ivy Sweet), a British actress. They married in 1933, but the marriage was soon dissolved after pressure from Docker's parents. His father had her tracked by private detectives, and after finding her with actor David Hutcheson, Docker divorced her.

MY Shemara

Docker commissioned John I. Thornycroft & Company to build a yacht to his specifications. The yacht was completed in 1938 and christened MY Shemara.

MY Shemara was requisitioned by the Royal Navy at the start of the Second World War in 1939 and used as a training vessel for anti-submarine warfare. It was during a training exercise with HMS Shemara that the submarine HMS Untamed was lost with all her crew. Shemara left RN service in 1946

Green Goddess

Docker commissioned Hooper & Co. to build a drophead coupé on a Daimler DE-36 chassis for display at the first post-war British International Motor Show at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in 1948. Named the ""Green Goddess"" by the press, the car had five seats, three windscreen wipers, and hydraulic operation of both the hood and the hood cover. After the show, the car was further tested and refined, after which it was kept by Docker for his personal use.

Six other chassis were bodied with similar bodies. These were all called ""Green Goddesses"" after the original, which was exhibited with jade-green coachwork and green-piped beige leather.

Second marriage
His second wife was Norah Collins (née Norah Royce Turner), a former showgirl that he married in 1949 as her third husband. She was the widow of Sir William Collins, the president of Fortnum & Mason, and also the widow of Clement Callingham, the head of Henekeys wine and spirits merchants.

The Dockers were often objects of ridicule because of the ostentatious flaunting of their wealth. In the 1950s, they bought and lavishly redecorated Glandyfi Castle in Wales. The comedian Frankie Howerd often referred to people as ""looking a bit like Lady Docker"".

Docker Daimlers

Sir Bernard Docker commissioned a series of Daimlers that were built to Lady Docker's specifications for the show circuit.
1951 – The Gold Car (a.k.a. Golden Daimler)
The Gold Car was a touring limousine on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis.  The car was covered with 7,000 tiny gold stars, and all plating that would normally have been chrome was gold. This car was taken to Paris, the United States and Australia.
1952 – Blue Clover
Also on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis, Blue Clover was a two-door sportsman's coupé.
1953 – Silver Flash
The Silver Flash was an aluminium-bodied coupé based on the 3-litre Regency chassis. Its accessories included solid silver hairbrushes and red fitted luggage made from crocodile skin.
1954 – Star Dust
based on the DF400 chassis 
1955 – Golden Zebra
The Golden Zebra was a two-door coupé based on the DK400 chassis. Like the Gold Car, the Golden Zebra had all its metal trim pieces plated in gold instead of chrome, and it had an ivory dashboard and zebra-skin upholstery.

Separation from Midland Bank
In January 1953, the chairman of Midland Bank asked Docker for his resignation from the board of directors. Docker, who had been a director of Midland Bank since 1928, refused to resign. The board of Midland Bank notified its shareholders that they were to be asked to remove Docker from the board at the annual general meeting being held that February.

The chairman stated that it was not in the bank's best interest to be associated with the publicity surrounding Docker, who replied to the shareholders that the publicity stemmed from three court proceedings, all of which had been either settled or found in his favour. In late January, Docker resigned from the board of Midland Bank with immediate effect, claiming there was a rumour of an impending charge for a currency offence.

Separation from BSA
At the end of May 1956, Docker was removed from the board of Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA), and he was replaced as chairman of BSA by Jack Sangster. The company, which owned the Docker Daimlers, had the Dockers return them.

The issues leading to the removal of Docker stemmed from the extravagant expenses he presented to the company, including the show cars made available for Lady Docker's personal use, a £5,000 gold and mink ensemble that Lady Docker wore at the 1956 Paris Motor Show that she tried to write off as a business expense as she ""was only acting as a model"" at the show, and Glandyfi Castle, bought with £12,500 of BSA's money and refurbished for £25,000, again with company money.

Decline and death
Without their main source of income, the Dockers began to run out of money. In 1965, Docker put Shemara on the market for £600,000; it was eventually sold for £290,000. In 1966, the Dockers sold their estate in Hampshire and moved to Jersey in the Channel Islands, becoming tax exiles.

Docker was placed in a nursing home in 1976, where he died on 22 May 1978. He was buried beside his wife's grave site in the Callingham family plot in the churchyard of St James the Less, Stubbings, near Maidenhead in Berkshire. Clement Callingham, Lady Docker's first husband, had been buried on the other side of her grave site.

Category:Daimler people","Sir Bernard Dudley Frank Docker ( 9 August 1896 – 22 May 1978 ) was an English industrialist . Born in Edgbaston , Birmingham , he was the only child of Frank Dudley Docker , an English businessman and financier .

Career
Docker was the managing director of the Birmingham Small Arms Company ( BSA ) group of companies from the early 1940s until 1956 . He also chaired The Daimler Company Limited and the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company . He became noted during the 1950s for producing show cars , such as the `` Golden Daimler '' ( 1952 ) , `` Blue Clover '' ( 1953 ) , `` Silver Flash '' ( 1953 ) , and `` Stardust '' ( 1954 ) .

He was succeeded by Jack Sangster as Chairman of BSA , following a 1956 boardroom coup . He also served as the chairman of the British Hospitals Association .

First marriage
Docker 's first wife was Jeanne Stuart ( née Ivy Sweet ) , a British actress . They married in 1933 , but the marriage was soon dissolved after pressure from Docker 's parents . His father had her tracked by private detectives , and after finding her with actor David Hutcheson , Docker divorced her .

MY Shemara

Docker commissioned John I. Thornycroft & Company to build a yacht to his specifications . The yacht was completed in 1938 and christened MY Shemara .

MY Shemara was requisitioned by the Royal Navy at the start of the Second World War in 1939 and used as a training vessel for anti-submarine warfare . It was during a training exercise with HMS Shemara that the submarine HMS Untamed was lost with all her crew . Shemara left RN service in 1946

Green Goddess

Docker commissioned Hooper & Co. to build a drophead coupé on a Daimler DE-36 chassis for display at the first post-war British International Motor Show at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in 1948 . Named the `` Green Goddess '' by the press , the car had five seats , three windscreen wipers , and hydraulic operation of both the hood and the hood cover . After the show , the car was further tested and refined , after which it was kept by Docker for his personal use .

Six other chassis were bodied with similar bodies . These were all called `` Green Goddesses '' after the original , which was exhibited with jade-green coachwork and green-piped beige leather .

Second marriage
His second wife was Norah Collins ( née Norah Royce Turner ) , a former showgirl that he married in 1949 as her third husband . She was the widow of Sir William Collins , the president of Fortnum & Mason , and also the widow of Clement Callingham , the head of Henekeys wine and spirits merchants .

The Dockers were often objects of ridicule because of the ostentatious flaunting of their wealth . In the 1950s , they bought and lavishly redecorated Glandyfi Castle in Wales . The comedian Frankie Howerd often referred to people as `` looking a bit like Lady Docker '' .

Docker Daimlers

Sir Bernard Docker commissioned a series of Daimlers that were built to Lady Docker 's specifications for the show circuit .
1951 – The Gold Car ( a.k.a . Golden Daimler )
The Gold Car was a touring limousine on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis . The car was covered with 7,000 tiny gold stars , and all plating that would normally have been chrome was gold . This car was taken to Paris , the United States and Australia .
1952 – Blue Clover
Also on the Thirty-Six Straight-Eight chassis , Blue Clover was a two-door sportsman 's coupé .
1953 – Silver Flash
The Silver Flash was an aluminium-bodied coupé based on the 3-litre Regency chassis . Its accessories included solid silver hairbrushes and red fitted luggage made from crocodile skin .
1954 – Star Dust
based on the DF400 chassis
1955 – Golden Zebra
The Golden Zebra was a two-door coupé based on the DK400 chassis . Like the Gold Car , the Golden Zebra had all its metal trim pieces plated in gold instead of chrome , and it had an ivory dashboard and zebra-skin upholstery .

Separation from Midland Bank
In January 1953 , the chairman of Midland Bank asked Docker for his resignation from the board of directors . Docker , who had been a director of Midland Bank since 1928 , refused to resign . The board of Midland Bank notified its shareholders that they were to be asked to remove Docker from the board at the annual general meeting being held that February .

The chairman stated that it was not in the bank 's best interest to be associated with the publicity surrounding Docker , who replied to the shareholders that the publicity stemmed from three court proceedings , all of which had been either settled or found in her favour . In late January , Docker resigned from the board of Midland Bank with immediate effect , claiming there was a rumour of an impending charge for a currency offence .

Separation from BSA
At the end of May 1956 , Docker was removed from the board of Birmingham Small Arms Company ( BSA ) , and he was replaced as chairman of BSA by Jack Sangster . The company , which owned the Docker Daimlers , had the Dockers return them .

The issues leading to the removal of Docker stemmed from the extravagant expenses he presented to the company , including the show cars made available for Lady Docker 's personal use , a £5,000 gold and mink ensemble that Lady Docker wore at the 1956 Paris Motor Show that she tried to write off as a business expense as she `` was only acting as a model '' at the show , and Glandyfi Castle , bought with £12,500 of BSA 's money and refurbished for £25,000 , again with company money .

Decline and death
Without their main source of income , the Dockers began to run out of money . In 1965 , Docker put Shemara on the market for £600,000 ; it was eventually sold for £290,000 . In 1966 , the Dockers sold their estate in Hampshire and moved to Jersey in the Channel Islands , becoming tax exiles .

Docker was placed in a nursing home in 1976 , where he died on 22 May 1978 . He was buried beside his wife 's grave site in the Callingham family plot in the churchyard of St James the Less , Stubbings , near Maidenhead in Berkshire . Clement Callingham , Lady Docker 's first husband , had been buried on the other side of her grave site .

Victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to ""Munshi"": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, ""the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do."" Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice. Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension on her death.","Why did Victoria 's family disapprove of Abdul Karim ?

840," How old was Jovanka Broz when she married Tito? His best known wife was Jovanka Broz. Tito was just shy of his 59th birthday, while she was 27, when they finally married in April 1952, with state security chief Aleksandar Ranković as the best man. Their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since Tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante Ivan Krajacic brought her in originally. At that time, she was in her early 20s and Tito, objecting to her energetic personality, opted for the more mature opera singer Zinka Kunc instead. Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at Beli Dvor, where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after Tito's strange relationship with Zinka failed. Since Jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power, she also went down in history as Yugoslavia's first lady. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children.","How old was Boris Broz when he married Tito?

865," What piece did Chopin dedicate to Liszt? Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a ""tinge of jealousy and spite"" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, ""I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies."" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as ""my friend Liszt"". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.","What piece did Chopin dedicate to Liszt ?

Life
He was born at Wakefield, Yorkshire, on 10 September 1749, the fourth son of James Robinson, a hosier there. He was sent at an early age to the Wakefield grammar school, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar in 1768. In April 1771 he was elected a scholar of his college, in 1772 he graduated as seventh wrangler (M.A. 1775), and in October of the same year he was made a fellow of his college.

Around 1772 Robinson was ordained to the joint curacies of Witcham and Wichford in the Isle of Ely, then from 1773 to 1778 he was afternoon lecturer at All Saints', Leicester, and chaplain to the infirmary. In 1778 he was appointed to a lectureship newly founded in St. Mary's Church, Leicester. Later on in the same year he was made vicar of St. Mary's. He founded a number of charities there.

Robinson died at Leicester on 24 March 1813, and was buried on the 29th in the chancel of St. Mary's. His funeral sermon was preached by Edward Thomas Vaughan, who published a memoir of Robinson, with a selection of his letters, in 1815. The religious state of Leicester at the time, and Robinson's contribution, were described in a published eulogy by Robert Hall shortly after Robinson's death.

Works
At St. Mary's in 1784 Robinson began the series of discourses on sacred biography by which he was best known. The earliest appeared in the Theological Miscellany of 1784, and the whole series was eventually printed under the title of Scripture Characters (1793, 4 vols.; 10th edit. 1815; abridgment, 1816). He wrote also The Christian System Unfolded, or Essays on the Doctrines and Duties of Christianity (1805, 3 vols.), and some shorter pieces. A collective edition of his Works was published in 8 vols. London, 1814.

Family
Robinson was twice married. By his first wife, who died in 1791, he had a son Thomas(1790–1873) who became master of the Temple. His second wife, whom he married in 1797, was the widow of James Gerard, Warden of Wadham College, Oxford.

Ibn Sina subsequently settled at Rey, in the vicinity of modern Tehran, the home town of Rhazes; where Majd Addaula, a son of the last Buwayhid emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother (Seyyedeh Khatun). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, Shams al-Daula, however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at Qazvin he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the Canon and the Sanatio, were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.","What city did Ibn Sina settle in ?

907," Robert Traill was a church minister at Cranbrook in Kent. He was born at Elie in Fife in 1642. He was incarcerated on the Bass Rock, in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19, 1677 to October 5, 1677. His work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century.

Early life

Robert's father was also a preacher called Robert. His father, Robert Traill of Greyfriars, was well known, being born in 1603, the son of Colonel James Trail, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. His mother, if Janet Annand (1605 - 1650), died while Robert was still young, although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband.

Robert Traill's early education was carefully superintended by his father, and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes. At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie, his father's friend, on the scaffold. He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet, and was afterwards much with John Welsh, the minister of Irongray, who was the first to hold ‘armed conventicles.’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick, author of ""The Christian's Great Interest"".

In 1666, he was obliged to lurk for fome time, together with his mother and elder brother; because some copies of a book, intitled, ""An apologetic relation, &c"", which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt, were found in Mrs Traill's house. In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘Pentland rebel’ and excepted from the act of indemnity. It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not; but he fled to Holland, where he joined his father, who had been there for about four years, and other Scottish exiles.

There he continued his theological studies, and assisted Nethenius, professor at Utrecht, in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford's ‘Examen Arminianismi.’ In 1669 he was in London, and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent. He visited Edinburgh in 1677, when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law. He admitted that he had preached in private houses, but, refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles, he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The sentence of in July 1677 read:
 ""Forasmuch as the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, finding by the Report of the Committee anent Public Affairs, that Mr Robert Traill, son of the deceased Mr Robert Traill, against whom letters of intercommuning are direct, and who is excepted forth of his Majesty's gracious act of indemnity for his being in the rebellion in the year 1666, being apprehended within the city of Edinburgh, and brought before the said Committee, and examined if since his last coming to this kingdom he had kept any house or field conventicles, did acknowledge he had kept house conventicles, but said he left it to proof as to field conventicles; and the verity thereof being referred to his own oath he refused to depone; and confessed he had conversed with Mr John Welsh on the borders, and had assisted him at preaching in the fields, but especially upon the borders of the English side, where he said he had stayed for the most part since he came last to Scotland; and that he had been in and about Edinburgh since the end of May last; and that being interrogated by what authority he took upon him to preach, he declared that, in the year 1670, he was ordained minister by some Presbyterian ministers at London; and acknowledged that he had seen the printed act of indemnity out of which his name is excepted: The said Lords do ordain the said Mr Robert Traill to be sent prisoner to the Bass, until the Council consider what further shall be done with him.""

On the same day,

""The Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council do grant warrant and order to the Lord Marquis of Athole, to command such a party of horse as he shall think fit to transport the person of Mr Robert Traill from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh unto the Isle of the Bass, to remain prisoner there.""

Having given a promise which satisfied the government, he was liberated a few months afterwards and returned to his charge in Kent. He afterwards migrated to a Scots church in London, where he spent the rest of his life.

Publications
His first short publication did not occur until he was forty years old and the next did not appear until he was fifty. In 1682 he published a sermon, ‘By what means can ministers best win souls?’ and in 1692 a letter to a minister in the country—supposed to be his eldest brother, William (1640–1714), minister of Borthwick, Midlothian—entitled ‘A Vindication of the Protestant Doctrine concerning Justification and of its Preachers and Professors from the unjust Charge of Antinomianism.’ This ‘angry letter,’ as Dr. Calamy calls it, was occasioned by the violent controversy which broke out among the dissenting ministers of London after the republication in 1690 of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp. Charges of Antinomianism were made on the one side and of Arminianism on the other, and Traill was distinguished for his zeal against Arminianism. A somewhat similar controversy, known as the Marrow Controversy, followed in Scotland, and as Boston of Ettrick and others took the same side as Traill, his works became very popular among them and their adherents. He afterwards published ‘Sermons on the Throne of Grace from Heb. iv. 16’ (3rd edit. 1731), and ‘Sermons on the Prayer of Our Saviour, John xvii. 24.’ These works were devout, plain, and edifying, and were in great favour with those who were attached to evangelical religion.

Death and legacy
Traill died on 16 May 1716 at the age of seventy-four. His brother William, the minister of Borthwick, has had many clerical descendants of note, both in the church of Scotland and in the church of Ireland—among the latter James, bishop of Down and Connor (Hew Scott, Fasti, i. 266).

A collective edition of Trail's works was published in 1745 (Edinburgh, 4 vols.); other editions Glasgow, 1776 3 vols., 1795 4 vols., 1806 4 vols. (which is the best edition), Edinburgh, 1810 4 vols. These included additional works from his manuscripts: ‘Steadfast Adherence to the Profession of our Faith, from Hebrews x. 23;’ ‘Sermons from 1 Peter i. 1–4;’ ‘Sermons on Galatians ii. 21.’ Further sermons from manuscripts in the hands of his relatives were published in 1845 by the Free Church of Scotland.

Family
According to some sources Robert married Hellenor Traill and had several children: James, born 10 March 1651; Helen, born 1644, Agnes, 1646-1690; and Margaret, January 1648 – 1617. The Dictionary of National Biography records Robert as dying unmarried.

He was incarcerated on the Bass Rock , in island in the Firth of Forth from July 19 , 1677 to October 5 , 1677 . His work was often quoted by J. C. Ryle and is still published in the 21st century .

Early life

Robert 's father was also a preacher called Robert . His father , Robert Traill of Greyfriars , was well known , being born in 1603 , the son of Colonel James Trail , of Killcleary , Ireland , Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry , Prince of Wales , and grandson of the Laird of Blebo , and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee . His mother , if Janet Annand ( 1605 - 1650 ) , died while Robert was still young , although the Dictionary of National Biography records a Jean Annand who was imprisoned in 1665 for corresponding with her husband .

Robert Traill 's early education was carefully superintended by his father , and at the university of Edinburgh he distinguished himself both in the literary and theological classes . At the age of nineteen he stood beside James Guthrie , his father 's friend , on the scaffold . He was for some time tutor or chaplain in the family of Scot of Scotstarvet , and was afterwards much with John Welsh , the minister of Irongray , who was the first to hold ‘ armed conventicles. ’ He became a lifelong friend of William Guthrie of Fenwick , author of `` The Christian 's Great Interest '' .

In 1666 , he was obliged to lurk for fome time , together with his mother and elder brother ; because some copies of a book , intitled , `` An apologetic relation , & c '' , which the privy council had ordered to be publicly burnt , were found in Mrs Traill 's house . In a proclamation of 1667 he was denounced as a ‘ Pentland rebel ’ and excepted from the act of indemnity . It is uncertain whether he was present at that engagement or not ; but he fled to Holland , where he joined his father , who had been there for about four years , and other Scottish exiles .

There he continued his theological studies , and assisted Nethenius , professor at Utrecht , in preparing for the press Samuel Rutherford 's ‘ Examen Arminianismi. ’ In 1669 he was in London , and in 1670 was ordained to a presbyterian charge at Cranbrook in Kent . He visited Edinburgh in 1677 , when he was arrested by the privy council and charged with breaking the law . He admitted that he had preached in private houses , but , refusing to purge himself by oath from the charge of taking part in holding conventicles , he was sent as a prisoner to the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth . The sentence of in July 1677 read :

913," Misogamy is an aversion or hatred of marriage. The word dates from the mid-17th century and combines the Greek misos (hatred) with gamos (marriage). Merriam-Webster date the first use of the word to around 1656.

Medieval background
The idea of misogamy was important in the Christian church during the medieval period as a prerequisite for the celibacy required to occupy the highest positions in the church. It was developed in the philosophy of Theophrastus who became the ""canonical authority on philosophic misogamy throughout the Middle Ages"". Sara E. Diaz writes that two types of misogamy existed during the period, one advising all men against marriage, and another more limited form advising wise men against marriage.

In literature
The literature of misogamy has been surveyed by Katharina Wilson and Elizabeth Makowski in their book Wykked Wyves and the Woes of Marriage: Misogamous Literature from Juvenal to Chaucer, published by the State University of New York in 1990.

957," The Martin D-28 is a dreadnought-style acoustic guitar made by C. F. Martin & Company of Nazareth, Pennsylvania. It is widely regarded amongst luthiers and guitarists alike as being the classic and even iconic American made acoustic guitar.

History
This guitar is a dreadnought design, a naval term adopted and used by many to describe its larger body dimensions, hence the ""D"" designation. When first created, the dreadnought guitar was seen as less favorable to the standard, smaller-sized guitars of its time. Sales finally started to take off in 1935, ""when they were given a single illustration on page 12 in the company's catalog, opposite a Hawaiian model."" The ad read:

""This is the famous 'Dreadnaught' bass guitar, originated by Martin in 1917 and now modernized for the plectrum style of playing. The extra wide and very deep body produces a tone of great power and smoothness, especially fine for broadcasting or recording. Rosewood body, spruce top, ivoroid edges, re-enforced mahogany neck, ebony fingerboard and bridge, wide frets, polished lacquer finish. Dark top on special order at no extra charge.""

Introduced by Martin in 1931, the D-28 is prized for its booming projection and high quality tone. The first batch went wholly to the Chicago Musical Instrument Company, although this ""exclusive"" deal didn't last for long. Originally built around the Martin D-14 Fret platform, early examples included exotic tone woods, such as Brazilian Rosewood, which is no longer available in large quantities due to deforestation and subsequent treaty controls. Original D28 guitars also used standard materials no longer found in current production models. For example, they had a distinct ""herringbone"" pattern that lined the top of the guitar. However, this touch was discontinued in 1946, as the German-made materials were no longer available post-World War II. Also the ""diamonds and squares"" fretboard inlays were reduced to plain dot styling around this time.

D28s were so popular at one point during the 1950s, that customers were waiting two years or more for one.

Current models
Note - starting with the 2017 D-28's Martin has switched to forward shifted X-bracing.
The modern D-28 is made of several high quality tone woods, including a solid Sitka spruce or Adirondack red spruce top, Indian rosewood back and sides, and mahogany neck. It uses the classic non scalloped X bracing pattern prior to 2017 pioneered by Martin, along with an ebony bridge and fret board.
Much of the construction is still done by hand although in recent years Martin has adopted computer controlled CNC machines to fashion the guitar's neck, and employs automated buffing and polishing machines, while maintaining the overall quality of the finished product. As of 2013, a base model sells for around $2,400 U.S.  Older models made in the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s can command far greater prices.

Variations
The D-28 has been made in several variations over the years, including:
 HD-28: Has scalloped braces, said to give the guitar a more ""open"" sound than a D-28. Also features the herringbone (or ""pre-war"") top border and a zigzag, or ""zipper"" backstrip.
 HD-28V: This variation resembles the original pre-war model and features both chrome butter-bean tuners and herringbone bindings around the aged-toned top. The X of its scalloped bracing pattern is shifted forward (toward the sound hole) by approximately one inch, making the lower bout top vibrate more freely/responsive, and resulting in a very potent and bass-rich guitar.   
 D28E: A very limited run version of the D-28 with special pickups placed at the end of the fretboard and near the bridge. While not generally well received, it is considered a collectors item
 D12-28: A 12-string version, otherwise the same as its brother the D-28.

958," To what position was Tiberius Gracchus elected? Tiberius Gracchus was elected tribune in 133 BC. He attempted to enact a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but the law was vetoed by a tribune named Marcus Octavius. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council to impeach Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority. His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.","To what position was Debra Gracchus elected?

964," ""Withdrawals"" is a song recorded by American country music artist Tyler Farr. It was released to radio on June 15, 2015 by Columbia Nashville as the second single from his second studio album Suffer in Peace. Written by Josh Kear, Gordie Sampson and Hillary Lindsey, the song is about a man dealing with the fallout of a relationship like an addiction. Despite receiving positive reviews from critics, ""Withdrawals"" had minor success compared to the previous single ""A Guy Walks Into a Bar"", peaking at numbers 47 and 52 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts respectively. This was due to the label wanting to withdraw the single from radio and release “Better in Boots” instead, feeling that a more upbeat single would climb the charts quicker and bolster his concert audience. An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Eric Welch, features Farr inside a glass box as he's being submerged into water as it fills up.

Background and development
""Withdrawals"" is a break-up song that deals with the fallout of a relationship like an addiction. While compiling the track list for Suffer in Peace, Farr came across the song in his inbox of potential tracks and chose it to be part of the album at the last minute. The demo's production, consisting only of a piano and drum loop, was what fascinated Farr because of its removal from his given genre, and that he wanted to record it into a country song as if done by the Foo Fighters. He also added that his vocal performance on the track adds believability to it and transcends it from a country song into a story.

Critical reception
Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song a positive review, saying that ""Tyler Farr won’t be offended if you double-check the name on the car stereo when “Withdrawals” gets to the chorus. This massive vocal performance sounds nothing like the more mid-register songs Farr has released from his first two albums. All that stuff about classical training … yeah, here it is."" Jamie Parmenter from Renowned for Sound said that Farr gives the track ""an attitude and ease of someone comfortable with himself."" In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin put ""Withdrawals"" at number four on his top 10 list of Farr's best songs.

Music video
The music video was directed by Eric Welch and premiered in June 2015. The video opens with a profile close-up of Farr as the camera goes into his eye and shows Farr inside a glass box as it fills with water. Farr said in an interview that the visual aesthetics were influenced by the industrial band Nine Inch Nails: ""When we were trying to come up with visuals to help explain the emotion, we looked at footage of Trent Reznor performances in NIN music videos, art galleries of people in glass boxes, and then tried our best to put those against the lyrics of the song.""

Chart performance
The song only reached number 52 on the Country Airplay chart before it was pulled from country radio.

966," Jennie Carolyn (Sullivan) Van Ness (August 27, 1879 – September 15, 1967) was a leader in the women's suffrage and Prohibition movements in New Jersey. She was one of the first two women to serve in the New Jersey Legislature, elected in 1920 as a Republican.

Early life and career

Jennie Carolyn Sullivan was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1879, the daughter of John and Caroline Sullivan. She married Frank W. Van Ness, a businessman, and they settled in East Orange, New Jersey, where they raised three daughters.

Van Ness worked as a substitute teacher at East Orange High School and was an active local civic organizer. She also joined the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association (NJWSA), a group founded by Lucy Stone and other New Jersey suffragists in 1867. Van Ness ran the NJWSA's citizenship schools, which sought to educate women throughout the state in government and politics. In April 1920, when the NJWSA was reorganized as the New Jersey League of Women Voters, she was made a regional director and also chaired a board to draw up a state program on legislative issues.

Legislative tenure

In September 1920, Van Ness was one of two women, along with Margaret B. Laird, designated by the Essex County Republican Party to run on the twelve-person slate for the New Jersey General Assembly. On announcing her candidacy, she was quoted by the Newark Evening News as saying,

Van Ness and Laird won and became the first two women to serve in the state legislature. Also elected on the Essex County slate was Walter G. Alexander, the first African American to serve in the legislature.

During her single term in the Assembly, Van Ness served on the standing committees for Education and for Unfinished Business, and on the joint committees for the Industrial School for Girls, the School for Feeble Minded Children, and the State Library. She supported Republican legislation granting women equal privileges in government employment, as well as equal representation on party committees.

Van Ness was best known for her sponsorship of a prohibition enforcement bill, known as the Van Ness Act. Attorneys with the Anti-Saloon League helped to draw up the legislation, which was intended to reinforce the federal Volstead Act. The Van Ness Act assessed severe penalties on the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages and provided for the trial of offenders before a magistrate without jury:

Introduced in early 1921, the act passed the Republican-controlled legislature over the veto of Governor Edward I. Edwards and became law. In the 1921 legislative election, ""wet"" (anti-Prohibition) candidates strenuously opposed the Van Ness Act as a violation of constitutional and personal liberties. Anti-Prohibition forces also made a special drive to defeat Van Ness in her Essex County race.  She was the only Republican candidate on the Essex County slate to fail to be reelected in November 1921.

The Van Ness Act was on the books for less than a year, as the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled it unconstitutional in February 1922.

Later life

After her defeat Van Ness continued to be active in the New Jersey Women's Republican Club, serving as the club's legislative chair in 1926. In 1927, she looked back on the first wave of suffragists to seek political office:

According to Past and Promise: Lives of New Jersey Women, ""after 1931 no reference to Van Ness appears in the public record."" She died on September 15, 1967 in Wilmington, North Carolina.

976," How old was Kangxi when he took over? The sixty-one year reign of the Kangxi Emperor was the longest of any Chinese emperor. Kangxi's reign is also celebrated as the beginning of an era known as the ""High Qing"", during which the dynasty reached the zenith of its social, economic and military power. Kangxi's long reign started when he was eight years old upon the untimely demise of his father. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon's dictatorial monopolizing of power during the regency, the Shunzhi Emperor, on his deathbed, hastily appointed four senior cabinet ministers to govern on behalf of his young son. The four ministers — Sonin, Ebilun, Suksaha, and Oboi — were chosen for their long service, but also to counteract each other's influences. Most important, the four were not closely related to the imperial family and laid no claim to the throne. However, as time passed, through chance and machination, Oboi, the most junior of the four, achieved such political dominance as to be a potential threat. Even though Oboi's loyalty was never an issue, his personal arrogance and political conservatism led him into an escalating conflict with the young emperor. In 1669 Kangxi, through trickery, disarmed and imprisoned Oboi — a significant victory for a fifteen-year-old emperor over a wily politician and experienced commander.","How old was Kangxi when he took over?

989," is a 1962 Japanese black-and-white crime action film directed by Kinji Fukasaku.

Plot
Kuroki, a reporter for the trade paper Tekko Shinpo, is investigating the arms manufacturer Mihara Industries on suspicion of the illegal trafficking of weapons from Japan to countries in Southeast Asia. He notices some foreign visitors leaving the company and discovers that they are purportedly visiting in order to attend an exhibit sponsored by Toyo Arts Society, which is led by Takayama Hiroshi. Kuroki confronts Takayama about the unsolved murder of Yamaguchi Natsuko on an Allied Forces army base where they both served during the Korean War. He had traced the murder back to special ops but was threatened to drop the investigation and was fired from Maicho Newspaper. Takayama admits that Natsuko worked for the Japanese-Russian League and was killed and made out to be a prostitute for refusing to gather information for the allies but continues to warn Kuroki to drop the story. Kuroki takes the story to Maicho Newspaper but they refuse to print a story critical of the intelligence department, just like before.

Kuroki bumps into his old friend Hiromi, who is now married to Sam, an African-American soldier who was injured in the Korean War. She works at Mihara Industries and is able to confirm that they are trafficking arms, though she does not know who the customer is.

Takayama is involved in an affair with Marin, the wife of Sudan, the leader to whom he is selling arms to aid him in crushing revolutionaries in his country. She is also secretly providing the leader of the revolutionaries with information so that they can stop the deal. Hiromi is abducted and a fake Dear John letter is sent to Sam. Kuroki blackmails Marin with a photo of her meeting with revolutionaries and she allows him to follow her to a mental hospital where he finds Hiromi caged in a cell, but he is then beaten and thrown into a different cell. Takayama suspects Marin of working with Kuroki and intends to interrogate him to discover if Marin has been working with him so Marin sneaks a gun to Kuroki through the bars of his cell. Kuroki uses it to escape and notifies the Tekko Shinpo that the arms are being loaded onto the ship that day. The revolutionaries end up attacking a decoy truck based on Marin's false information while the weapons from the other trucks are successfully shipped out aboard the ship.

Kuroki has Hiromi released from the mental hospital but she is seriously traumatized from the experience and Sam shouts at the staff in despair. Kuroki confronts Marin and Takayama and threatens to publish the story, but Takayama explains that there is more to the story. The revolutionaries arrive and Takayama sells them information about where the weapons will be unloaded upon arrival in their country. The revolutionaries board the ship and find evidence that the weapons were shipped from Japan but the Japanese authorities deny it and Allied Forces officials attempt to stop the story as well as Takayama. Takayama overhears Marin calling the Allied Forces and telling his location in exchange for the ability to flee to America to avoid retaliation by the revolutionaries, so in retaliation Takayama calls the revolutionaries and gives them Marin's location. Marin flees the hotel where they were hiding but is stabbed to death on the street in broad daylight.

Takayama calls Kuroki and tells him to meet him one last time at Landfill 4 for the full story about the arms deal, but is shot and run over by Allied Forces members before Kuroki can reach him. The newspapers run cover stories suggesting yakuza wars as the cause. Kuroki complains to Natsuko's sister that nothing has changed in ten years, but she encourages him not to let himself be defeated.

Production and release
The film was shot in black and white with mono sound. It was produced by Toei Tokyo and distributed by Toei Company. It was released in Japan on March 28, 1962.

Reception and analysis
In an interview with Chris D. in the book Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film, Fukasaku explained that The Proud Challenge ""was meant as an exposé of the CIA's plot to crush the Communist and socialist left in Japan.""

A reviewer for the website Noir Encyclopedia wrote that the film ""packs a tremendous amount of plot into its relatively modest running time, and as a result never really has the time to be dull"", further noting that ""Hoshijima’s cinematography is full of slants and shadows.""

Reviewer Patrick McCoy of the website Lost In Translation wrote that The Proud Challenge ""grabs the viewer's attention immediately"" and concluded that ""the film is a suspenseful thriller that offers a critique of political corruption, hypocrisy, and journalistic cowardice in postwar Japan.""

In the article ""The Secret History of Japanese Cinema: The Yakuza movies"", author Federico Varese wrote that the film ""had a clear political message: a reporter uncovers evidence that a Japanese company is exporting weapons to Southeast Asia with the complicity of the CIA. The final scene suggests that the entire fabric of Japanese democracy is controlled by American interests aimed at crushing the socialist left (Toei's conservative managers seriously objected to the wider implication of the movie and put Fukasaku on probation for six months).""
